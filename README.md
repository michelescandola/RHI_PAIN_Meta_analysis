# RHI_PAIN_Meta_analysis

R code to conduct the systematic review and meta-analysis on the modulation of pain sensations caused by various forms of rubber hand illusion

## Description:

The relationship between pain perception and the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) remains debated, with studies reporting hypoalgesic, hyperalgesic, or null effects. Given findings that mere body observation can induce hypoalgesia, we hypothesize that a similar mechanism may underlie RHI’s effects. To clarify these discrepancies, we will conduct a systematic review assessing RHI’s impact on pain perception and evaluating methodological rigor using a Transparency Of Methods (TOM) checklist. We predict that studies with higher bias may also score lower on transparency, helping to identify sources of variability in reported effects.
