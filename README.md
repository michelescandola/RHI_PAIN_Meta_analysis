R code for a **systematic review** and **meta-analysis** exploring how the *Rubber Hand Illusion* (RHI) influences pain perception â€” with a commitment to **open, transparent, and reproducible science**.

---

## Project Overview

Does the *Rubber Hand Illusion* reduce pain, increase it, or have no effect at all?  
The literature is surprisingly mixed â€” some studies report hypoalgesia, others hyperalgesia, and some no change.

We believe part of the answer lies in study design.  
Since merely looking at oneâ€™s body can sometimes reduce pain, we hypothesize that a similar mechanism may underlie RHI effects.  

To address these inconsistencies, we will:

- **Systematically review** all available studies on RHI and pain perception.
- **Meta-analyze** their effects.
- **Evaluate methodological transparency** using our *Transparency Of Methods* (TOM) checklist.
- Explore whether higher bias is associated with lower transparency.

This project is **fully pre-registered**, and all code/data are shared here for open verification and reuse.
