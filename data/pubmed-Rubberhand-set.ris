AB  - We manipulated the sense of body ownership with the rubber hand illusion (RHI) to determine if perception of a potentially painful threat to the rubber hand can  modify the mechanical pain threshold (MPT). Simultaneous tactile stimulation of  the subject's concealed hand and the appropriately positioned visible rubber hand  generated the illusion of false body ownership. The MPT was recorded on the left  hand of the subjects before and after induction of the RHI, as well as during the  phase in which the model hand was pricked with a sharp knife or touched by the  blunt knife handle. The results indicate that the RHI could be successfully  generated with our set-up. Mechanical stimuli were perceived as more painful in  the condition where the rubber hand was simultaneously pricked with a knife. Our  findings suggest that the illusion of body ownership gates nociceptive processing  of potentially painful stimuli.

AB  - Adaptive behavior usually requires accurate representations of body positions and ownership, which rely on integration of multiple sources of sensory information.  The rubber hand illusion (RHI) presents a compelling example demonstrating that  the combination of visual and tactile signals strongly influences the subjective  experience of body ownership. However, it still remains unclear how the  perception of body ownership in turn alters other aspects of sensory processing,  such as pain perception. In the present study, we examined whether the RHI could  modulate the subjective experience of pain. We set three conditions corresponding  to different levels of ownership of the rubber hand: the synchronous condition in  which the rubber and the real hand were simultaneously stroked; the asynchronous  condition in which the two hands were asynchronously stroked; the own-hand-only  condition in which only the real hand was stroked. Results from the screening  experiment indicated that subjects experienced the stronger RHI in the  synchronous condition, compared with the strength of RHI in the other two  conditions. In the main experiment, subjects were requested to report the  intensity and unpleasantness of pain evoked by laser stimuli under the three  stroking conditions. Results showed that pain ratings were significantly lower  under the synchronous condition than those under the other two conditions,  suggesting the RHI could induce a significant analgesic effect. Furthermore, the  correlation analysis showed that the degree of the analgesic effect was  positively correlated with the RHI strength across individuals. Taken together,  these results suggest an analgesic effect of the RHI and support the potential  usage of visual illusions in future translational research on pain.

AB  - The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is a perceptual experience which often occurs when an administered tactile stimulation of a person's real hand hidden from view,  occurs synchronously with a corresponding visual stimulation of an observed  rubber hand placed in full vision of the person in a position corresponding to  where their real hand might normally be. The perceptual illusion is that the  person feels a sense of "ownership" of the rubber hand which they are looking at.  Most studies have focused on the underlying neural properties of the illusion and  the experimental manipulations that lead to it. The illusion could also be used  for exploring the sense of limb and prosthetic ownership for people after  amputation. Cortical electrodes such as those used in sensorimotor stimulation  surgery for pain may provide an opportunity to further understand the cortical  representation of the illusion and possibly provide an opportunity to modulate  the individual's sense of body ownership. Thus, the RHI might also be a critical  tool for development of neurorehabilitative interventions that will be of great  interest to the neurosurgical and rehabilitation communities.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Consistent with the Bayesian brain hypothesis, the within-subject variability of pain intensity reports as captured with the Focused Analgesia  Selection Test (FAST) might be a surrogate measure of the certainty in ascending  noxious signals. The outcomes of a non-pain-related task, the rubber hand  illusion, were hypothesized to reflect the same construct. This study aimed to  explore whether within-subject differences in variability of pain intensity  reports and the outcomes of the rubber hand illusion might be related. METHODS:  Nonclinical participants underwent the classic rubber hand illusion under  synchronous (experimental) and asynchronous (control) conditions. Two outcomes  were assessed: proprioceptive drift and feeling of ownership. Thereafter,  participants underwent the FAST to assess the within-subject variability of pain  reports in response to heat stimuli. Intraclass correlation (ICC) and the  correlation coefficient (R(2)) were the main outcomes. Spearman's correlations  were used to assess associations between the outcomes of the 2 tasks. RESULTS:  Thirty-six volunteers completed the study. Both FAST outcomes-ICC (Spearman's  r = 0.355, p = 0.033) and R(2) (Spearman's r = 0.349, p = 0.037)-were positively  correlated with proprioceptive drift in the synchronous but not asynchronous  conditions (p > 0.05). The subjective feeling of ownership and FAST outcomes did  not correlate (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The associations between the 2 tasks'  outcomes imply that both tasks at least partly assess similar constructs. Current  knowledge suggests that this construct represents the person's certainty in  perceiving ascending sensory signals, or, in Bayesian terminology, the certainty  of the likelihood.

AB  - The rubber hand illusion (RHI) has been shown to alter the experience of pain, although studies have yielded inconsistent results. In this experiment we tested  the influence of the RHI on the intensity of pain caused by electric stimuli.  Electric stimuli were delivered to participants' experimental and control hands  before RHI induction (control condition) and afterward (experimental condition),  in a procedure that was double-blind with respect to location and strength of  noxious stimulation. All hands were covered during the stimulation to avoid the  analgesic effect of seeing one's own body part. The perceived location of the  hand and of pain were measured after each trial in the experimental condition.  The results showed that noxious stimuli were experienced as more painful on the  hand under the illusion. In addition, in the experimental condition the perceived  location of noxious stimulation applied to the experimental hand drifted toward  the rubber hand. Our data suggest that the link between bodily illusions and pain  could be modulated by uncertainty about location of pain and the affected body  part. Future studies should aim to determine which aspects of altered body  awareness lead to pain sensitization. PERSPECTIVE: We show that the RHI can  change the perceived location of pain and increase pain ratings caused by  electric stimuli. Our data suggest that the link between bodily illusions and  pain could be modulated by uncertainty about location of pain and the affected  body part.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence shows that manipulations of cortical body representation, for example, by simply viewing one's own body, can relieve pain  in healthy subjects. Despite the widespread use of the rubber hand illusion (RHI)  as an effective experimental tool for the manipulation of bodily awareness,  previous studies examining the analgesic effect of the RHI have produced  conflicting results. METHOD: We used noxious heat stimuli to induce finger pain  in 29 healthy subjects, and we recorded the participants' pain thresholds and  subjective pain ratings during the RHI and during the control conditions. Two  control conditions were included in our experiment - a standard one with reduced  illusion strength (asynchronous stroking control) and an additional one in which  the participants viewed their own hand. RESULTS: Raw data showed that both the  RHI and the vision of the own hand resulted in slightly higher pain thresholds  than the asynchronous stroking control (illusion: 47.79 °C; own-hand: 47.99 °C;  asynchronous: 47.52 °C). After logarithmic transformation to achieve normality,  paired t-tests revealed that both increases in pain threshold were significant  (illusion/asynchronous: p = 0.036; own-hand/asynchronous: p = 0.007). In  contrast, there was no significant difference in pain threshold between the  illusion and the own-hand conditions (p = 0.656). Pain rating scores were not  log-normal, and Wilcoxon singed-rank tests found no significant differences in  pain ratings between the study conditions. CONCLUSION: The RHI increases heat  pain threshold and the analgesic effect of the RHI is comparable with that of  seeing one's own hand. The latter finding may have clinical implications.

T2  - Consciousness and cognition
AB  - The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) paradigm has been widely used to investigate the sense of body ownership. People who report experiencing the pain of others are  hypothesised to have differences in computing body ownership and, hence, we  predicted that they would perform atypically on the RHI. The Vicarious Pain  Questionnaire (VPQ), was used to divide participants into three groups: (1)  non-responders (people who report no pain when seeing someone else experiencing  physical pain), (2) sensory-localised responders (report sensory qualities and a  localised feeling of pain) and (3) affective-general responders (report a  generalised and emotional feeling of pain). The sensory-localised group, showed  susceptibility to the RHI (increased proprioceptive drift) irrespective of  whether stimulation was synchronous or asynchronous, whereas the other groups  only showed the RHI in the synchronous condition. This is not a general bias to  always incorporate the dummy hand as we did not find increased susceptibility in  other conditions (seeing touch without feeling touch, or feeling touch without  seeing touch), but there was a trend for this group to incorporate the dummy hand  when it was stroked with a laser light. Although individual differences in the  RHI have been noted previously, this particular pattern is rare. It suggests a  greater malleability (i.e. insensitivity to asynchrony) in the conditions in  which other bodies influence own-body judgments.

TI  - Verbal Suggestion Modulates the Sense of Ownership and Heat Pain Threshold During the "Injured" Rubber Hand Illusion.
AU  - Tanaka, Tomoya

AU  - Morioka, Shu
T2  - Frontiers in human neuroscience
AB  - The appearance of the self-body influences the feeling that one's body belongs to oneself, that is, a sense of ownership (SoO) and pain perception. This can be  identified by measuring the SoO and pain thresholds after performing the rubber  hand illusion (RHI) with an injured rubber hand. The generation of SoO is thought  to be caused by multisensory integration of bottom-up factors (vision,  proprioceptive, and touch), and by top-down factors, such as the context effect.  The appearance is one of the context effects which may become more effective when  used simultaneously with other context effects (e.g., verbal suggestion).  However, in the RHI, when appearance and other context effects are used  simultaneously, the effect is unclear. In this study, we attempted to identify  the influence of verbal suggestion on the SoO and heat pain threshold (HPT). As a  preliminary step, in Experiment 1, the "normal" rubber hand and "penetrated nail"  as injured rubber hand were used to clarify the context effect with appearance  alone during RHI (synchronous/asynchronous), which was conducted within-subjects.  In Experiment 2, we only used the "penetrated nail" rubber hand to clarify the  context effect with verbal suggestion and appearance during RHI. We randomly  classified participants into two suggestion groups ("fear" and "no-fear"). The  RHI (synchronous/asynchronous) was conducted for each group. In each experiment,  the effect of each condition was assessed by subjective measures of SoO, such as  questionnaire, and objective measures of SoO, such as proprioceptive drift and  electrodermal activity. Following RHI in each condition, HPT was measured. The  main finding was that, in the synchronous condition, the "penetrated nail"  appearance with "fear" verbal suggestion modulated questionnaire and HPT, but not  electrodermal activity. We conclude that the context-included multisensory  integration affected the subjective factors because it contains a higher  cognitive process by verbal suggestion.

AB  - The coherent perceptual experience of one's own body depends on the processing and integration of signals from multiple sensory modalities, including vision,  touch, and proprioception. Although nociception provides critical information  about damage to the tissues of one's body, little is known about how nociception  contributes to own-body perception. A classic experimental approach to  investigate the perceptual and neural mechanisms involved in the multisensory  experience of one's own body is the rubber hand illusion (RHI). During the RHI,  people experience a rubber hand as part of their own body (sense of body  ownership) caused by synchronized stroking of the rubber hand in the  participant's view and the hidden participant's real hand. We examined whether  the RHI can be elicited by visual and "pure" nociceptive stimulation, ie, without  tactile costimulation, and if so, whether it follows the basic perceptual rules  of the illusion. In 6 separate experiments involving a total of 180 healthy  participants, we used a Nd:YAP laser stimulator to specifically target C and Aδ  fibers in the skin and compared the illusion condition (congruent  visuonociceptive stimulation) to control conditions of incongruent  visuonociceptive, incongruent visuoproprioceptive, and no nociceptive  stimulation. The illusion was quantified through direct (questionnaire) and  indirect (proprioceptive drift) behavioral measures. We found that a nociceptive  rubber hand illusion (N-RHI) could be elicited and that depended on the  spatiotemporal congruence of visuonociceptive signals, consistent with basic  principles of multisensory integration. Our results suggest that nociceptive  information shapes multisensory bodily awareness and contributes to the sense of  body ownership.

T2  - Quarterly journal of experimental psychology (2006)
AB  - Some people report localised pain on their body when seeing other people in pain (sensory-localised vicarious pain responders). In this study, we assess whether  this is related to atypical computations of body ownership which, in paradigms  such as the rubber hand illusion (RHI), can be conceptualised as a Bayesian  inference as to whether multiple sources of sensory information (visual,  somatosensory) belong together on a single body (one's own) or are distributed  across several bodies (vision = other, somatosensory = self). According to this  model, computations of body ownership depend on the degree (and precision) of  sensory evidence, rather than synchrony per se. Sensory-localised vicarious pain  responders exhibit the RHI following synchronous stroking and-unusually-also  after asynchronous stroking. Importantly, this occurs only in asynchronous  conditions in which the stroking is predictable (alternating) rather than  unpredictable (random). There was no evidence that their bottom-up proprioceptive  signals are less precise, suggesting individual differences in the top-down  weighting of sensory evidence. Finally, the enfacement illusion (EI) was also  employed as a conceptually related bodily illusion paradigm that involves a  completely different response judgement (based on vision rather than  proprioception). Sensory-localised responders show a comparable pattern on this  task after synchronous and asynchronous stroking. This is consistent with the  idea that they have top-down (prior) differences in the way body ownership is  inferred that transcends the exact judgement being made (visual or  proprioceptive).

AB  - The sense of body ownership can be easily disrupted during illusions and the most common illusion is the rubber hand illusion. An idea that is rapidly gaining  popularity in clinical pain medicine is that body ownership illusions can be used  to modify pathological pain sensations and induce analgesia. However, this idea  has not been empirically evaluated. Two separate research laboratories undertook  independent randomized repeated measures experiments, both designed to detect an  effect of the rubber hand illusion on experimentally induced hand pain. In  Experiment 1, 16 healthy volunteers rated the pain evoked by noxious heat stimuli  (5 s duration; interstimulus interval 25 s) of set temperatures (47°, 48° and  49°C) during the rubber hand illusion or during a control condition. There was a  main effect of stimulus temperature on pain ratings, but no main effect of  condition (p = 0.32), nor a condition x temperature interaction (p = 0.31). In  Experiment 2, 20 healthy volunteers underwent quantitative sensory testing to  determine heat and cold pain thresholds during the rubber hand illusion or during  a control condition. Secondary analyses involved heat and cold detection  thresholds and paradoxical heat sensations. Again, there was no main effect of  condition on heat pain threshold (p = 0.17), nor on cold pain threshold (p =  0.65), nor on any of the secondary measures (p<0.56 for all). We conclude that  the rubber hand illusion does not induce analgesia.

AB  - Interoception is the sensation of the physiological state inside one's body. Growing evidence suggests that visual feedback of interoception improves body  self-consciousness (BSC) and reduces pain perception among patients with chronic  pain. However, whether the integration of exteroception and interoception  influences pain processing in healthy individuals remains largely unknown. To  examine this question, we combined the rubber hand illusion (RHI) paradigm with  visualized interoception -flashing of an LED light on the rubber hand  synchronously or asynchronously with participants' real-time heartbeats. Under  these conditions, we tested pain thresholds and corresponding event-related  potentials. The interoceptive visual feedback inhibited the P2 component of pain,  and the RHI inhibited pre-stimulus alpha-band brain activity. BSC had no  significant effect on the processing of pain. These findings demonstrate that  interoceptive signals with visual feedback inhibit pain processing, and that this  psychophysiological process is largely independent of reported  self-consciousness, in healthy individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rubber hand illusion (RHI) is an experience that causes changes in body perception and awareness as a result of the integration of simultaneous  perceived visual and tactile stimuli. After synchronous brush strokes with rubber  and real hands, the person perceives the rubber hand as their own. RHI is known  to alter pain perception. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effects of  RHI on pressure pain threshold and continuity of this effect. METHODS:  Twenty-three volunteers who developed RHI were included in our study and two  conditions, illusion (synchronous) and control (asynchronous), were applied. The  illusion condition was created by synchronous brush strokes, while the control  condition was created by asynchronous brush application using different frequency  and different finger areas in the same individuals. In both conditions, pressure  pain threshold measurements with an algometer were performed at four times:  baseline/1st measurement, during the brush stroke/2nd measurement, at the end of  the brush stroke/3rd measurement and after the hand was removed from the  environment/4th measurement. RESULTS: It was shown that RHI increased the  pressure-pain threshold (p = 0.004) in healthy volunteers. Asynchronous brush  strokes arranged as a control trial significantly decreased the pressure pain  threshold (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: It was found that the threshold values that  change during the brush strokes return to the initial state after the brush  strokes are terminated and the rubber hand is removed from the environment so  that the effect of the illusion does not last for a long time with a single  session application.

TI  - The rubber hand illusion is a fallible method to study ownership of prosthetic limbs.

AB  - Enabling sensory feedback in limb prostheses can reverse a damaged body image caused by amputation. The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is a popular paradigm to  study ownership of artificial limbs and potentially useful to assess sensory  feedback strategies. We investigated the RHI as means to induce ownership of a  prosthetic hand by providing congruent visual and tactile stimuli. We elicited  tactile sensations via electric stimulation of severed afferent nerve fibres in  four participants with transhumeral amputation. Contrary to our expectations,  they failed to experience the RHI. The sensations we elicited via nerve  stimulation resemble tapping as opposed to stroking, as in the original RHI. We  therefore investigated the effect of tapping versus stroking in 30 able-bodied  subjects. We found that either tactile modality equally induced ownership in  two-thirds of the subjects. Failure to induce the RHI in the intact hand of our  participants with amputation later confirmed that they form part of the  RHI-immune population. Conversely, these participants use neuromusculoskeletal  prostheses with neural sensory feedback in their daily lives and reported said  prostheses as part of their body. Our findings suggest that people immune to the  RHI can nevertheless experience ownership over prosthetic limbs when used in  daily life and accentuates a significant limitation of the RHI paradigm.

AB  - Our sense of body ownership results from the ongoing integration of perceptual information coming from the different senses (i.e., multisensory integration).  The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) has been extensively studied to investigate the  malleability of body ownership through contrasting multisensory information.  Indeed, during the RHI, stroking a visible rubber hand synchronously to  participants' hand hidden from sight generates the illusion of ownership of the  rubber hand (embodiment) and the mis-location of participants' hand as closer to  the rubber hand (proprioceptive drift). It is well known that the RHI is  optimally evoked by a pleasant stroking (affective) touch, but what of an  unpleasant (painful) stroking touch - does hedonic valence matter? To this aim,  participants repeated the RHI while receiving different types of touch: pleasant,  painful, and neutral. Results showed, for the first time, that the subjective  intensity of the tactile stimulation experienced across the different conditions  modulates the strength of the proprioceptive drift. Notably, participants  reported a stronger RHI (mis-placed body ownership) from stimulation rated as  more intense and involving an interoceptive activation (pain and pleasantness vs.  neutral). We propose that interoceptive information, regardless of the valence of  the stimuli (positive or negative), are perceived as more intense and enhance,  through the activation of the limbic system, multisensory integration. In the  context of the RHI, this translates to a stronger illusion in terms of  proprioceptive drift.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous investigations on pain modulatory effects of the rubber hand illusion (RHI) yielded mixed results. However, these studies used separate  stimuli to induce pain and the RHI. Using a visual-thermal stimulation approach,  the illusion-inducing stimulus was simultaneously the pain stimulus which ensured  that participants focused entirely on the illusion-inducing stimulus. OBJECTIVES:  In this study, we investigated the time course of pain modulation induced by  illusionary body ownership over artificial hands using the visual-thermal RHI and  the influence of the stimulation intensity. METHODS: In a 2 × 4 within-subject  design, participants received thermal stimulation on their hidden real left hand,  while the rubber hand synchronously lit up red. Four stimulation intensities were  used: moderate pain (+0°C), -0.75°C, +0.75°C, and +1.5°C. For control trials, the  rubber hand was rotated by 180°. With the right hand, participants provided  continuous pain ratings using a slide knob. RESULTS: Embodiment ratings were  higher in the RHI compared with the control condition. Continuous pain ratings  were lower in the RHI condition for all temperature levels except for +0.75°C.  Rubber hand illusion-induced pain reduction was observed throughout most of the  stimulation interval, absent only at the very beginning and end. CONCLUSION:  These findings suggest that visual-thermal induction of the RHI is consistently  associated with increased embodiment ratings, regardless of the temperature level  presented. The illusion is further accompanied by reduced pain ratings throughout  major parts of the stimulation interval. On the whole, these findings speak for  the robustness of the effect and the practicality of our visual-thermal  stimulation approach.

TI  - Real, rubber or virtual: The vision of "one's own" body as a means for pain modulation. A narrative review.
AU  - Martini, Matteo
T2  - Consciousness and cognition
AB  - In the last few years a branch of pain research has been focussing on the modulatory effects of the vision of the body on pain perception. So, for  instance, the vision of one's own real body has been proven to induce analgesic  effects. On the other hand, bodily illusions such as the rubber hand illusion  have provided new tools for the study of perceptual processes during altered body  ownership states. Recently, new paradigms of body ownership made use of a  technology that is going places both in clinical and in experimental settings,  i.e. virtual reality. While the vision of one's own real body has been proven to  yield compelling analgesic effects, slightly more controversial are those  attributed to the vision of "owned" dummy bodies. This review will discuss the  studies that examined the effects on pain perception of the vision of the own  body, with or without body ownership illusions.

AB  - Pain represents an embodied experience, wherein inferences are not only drawn from external sensory inputs, but also from bodily states. Previous research has  demonstrated that a placebo administered to an embodied rubber hand can  effectively induce analgesia, providing first evidence that placebos can work  even when applied to temporarily embodied, artificial body parts. Using a heat  pain paradigm, the present study investigates placebo analgesia and pain  perception during virtual embodiment. We examined whether a virtual placebo (a  sham heat protective glove) can successfully induce analgesia, even when  administered to a virtual body. The analgesic efficacy of the virtual placebo to  the real hand (augmented reality setting) or virtual hand (virtual reality  setting) was compared to a physical placebo administered to the own, physical  body (physical reality setting). Furthermore, pain perception and subjective  embodiment were compared between settings. In this mixed design experiment,  healthy participants (n = 48) were assigned to either an analgesia-expectation or  control-expectation group, where subjective and objective pain was measured at  pre- and post-intervention time points. Results demonstrate that pre-intervention  pain intensity was lower in the virtual reality setting, and that participants in  the analgesia-expectation group, after the intervention, exhibited significantly  higher pain thresholds, and lower pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings than  control-expectation participants, independent of the setting. Our findings show  that a virtual placebo can elicit placebo analgesia comparable to that of a  physical placebo, and that administration of a placebo does not necessitate  physical bodily interaction to produce analgesic responses. PERSPECTIVE: This  study demonstrates that a virtual placebo treatment, even when administered to a  virtual body, can produce placebo analgesia. These findings indicate that the  efficacy of a virtual placebo is comparable to that of a physical placebo, which  could pave the way for effective new non-pharmacological approaches for pain  management.

AB  - There is a growing interest in body-ownership disruptions and their consequences for subjective experiences such as tactile sensations or pain. Here, we  investigated the effect of the rubber hand illusion (RHI) on the perceived  discomfort caused by cold stimulus applied to the real hand. The results showed  reduced discomfort to cold reflected in behavioural and subjective measures. The  stronger the illusion, the later the cold temperature became unpleasant and the  less intense the experience was rated. We discuss the link between thermoception  and body ownership as well as possible theoretical and methodological  implications for studies on pain experience under RHI.

AB  - The bodily boundaries in amputees may seem to be more malleable than in non-amputees, given the propensity for a phantom limb to embody a  mirror-reflected hand. However, in the present investigation, in which  phantom-limb illusions within body space are induced and manipulated, we found  that perceiving phantom sensations and illusory embodiment does not require  amputation. Surprisingly, in the present modified rubber-hand illusion, we found  that simultaneous stroking or stimulation of the participant's target hand was  not necessary to induce illusions of embodiment and corresponding perceptual  illusions. We tested this upper-limb paradigm in fourteen upper-limb amputees and  twenty-six controls (including fourteen lower-limb amputees). We propose a model  for embodiment of a rubber or real hand passively observed in a mirror. In this  model, passive observation of the hand in the mirror triggers body  representations (body image and body schema), most likely through activation of  the posterior parietal cortex and temporo-parietal junction. Activity in these  regions heightens awareness of peripersonal space and increases tactile  sensitivity, and may subsequently enhance perception of illusory touch and  embodiment. Furthermore, sense of embodiment may be more apparent to the  participant when the hand is threatened; however, embodiment may even be  strengthened when the motor system is engaged, evoking motor schemata to support  the more easily induced perceptual embodiment via body image.

T2  - The journal of pain
AB  - Placebo analgesia, reductions in pain after administration of an inert treatment, is a well documented phenomenon. We report, to our knowledge, the first  demonstration that placebo analgesia can be experienced when a sham analgesic is  applied onto a rubber hand. The effect was obtained by exploiting the rubber hand  illusion, in which ownership is felt over a rubber arm that is unattached to the  body. Under conditions of synchronous as well as asynchronous visuotactile  stimulation, a thermal pain stimulus was delivered on the real arm of 20  participants and seemingly also on the rubber arm, before and after applying a  sham analgesic and a control cream only to the rubber arm. During synchronous  visuotactile stimulation, pain was experienced on the rubber arm, and the  application of the sham analgesic to the rubber arm significantly decreased the  severity of reported pain. This shows that experience of the body can modulate  expectations and the induction of placebo analgesia. PERSPECTIVE: This article  presents an experiment suggesting that a placebo treatment applied to a rubber  hand during the rubber hand illusion can produce placebo analgesia. This finding  indicates that embodiment may influence the placebo effect, a previously  unexamined factor in the treatment process with potential applications to  treatment administration.

AB  - The visual capture phenomenon has recently been explored, especially in the context of the rubber-hand illusion (RHI)--an illusion in which tactile  sensations are referred to an illusory limb. We have induced the RHI with the  difference that tactile-painful stimuli were added in order to verify the  interaction between vision, touch, proprioception, and pain. Thirty volunteers  were used. We found that tactile-painful stimuli could cause the same illusion as  purely tactile stimuli. This result suggests that localisation of pain may also  be distorted by spurious visual cues. The implications of this finding for  distorted human proprioception (as in amputees with phantom pain or limbs) are  discussed.

AB  - In hypnotic responding, expectancies arising from imaginative suggestion drive striking experiential changes (e.g., hallucinations) - which are experienced as  involuntary - according to a normally distributed and stable trait ability  (hypnotisability). Such experiences can be triggered by implicit suggestion and  occur outside the hypnotic context. In large sample studies (of 156, 404 and 353  participants), we report substantial relationships between hypnotisability and  experimental measures of experiential change in mirror-sensory synaesthesia and  the rubber hand illusion comparable to relationships between hypnotisability and  individual hypnosis scale items. The control of phenomenology to meet  expectancies arising from perceived task requirements can account for  experiential change in psychological experiments.

AB  - In this study, we investigated whether illusionary body ownership over artificial hands and non-corporeal objects modulates pain perception. Previous research has  yielded to mixed results, but has separated painful stimulation used to test pain  perception from the stimulation that was used to induce the illusion. Here, we  used a variant of the rubber hand illusion (RHI) paradigm and induced the  illusion directly via a combination of visual and painful stimuli. We presented  heat pain stimuli at the real hand and visual stimuli beneath a rubber hand  (part1), or a glass ball (part2). Illusion ratings were higher and pain ratings  were lower in the synchronous compared to the asynchronous condition in both  parts of the experiment. This study demonstrated the successful induction of a  body illusion using a new visual-thermal method with painful stimuli. We showed  that the RHI and interestingly also the glass ball has an analgesic effect on the  perception of the heat pain stimuli. Our data suggests that induced ownership  over artificial limbs but also over non-corporeal objects can reduce the  perceived pain perception. This might be mediated via a partial referral of the  perceived location of pain or respectively a distribution of pain over 2  locations. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents a new visual-thermal method with  painful stimuli for the induction of the Rubber Hand Illusion. An illusionary  body ownership over artificial hands and non-corporeal has an analgesic effects  on the perception of pain. Similar approaches might be useful to alleviate  chronic pain, but needs further testing.

AB  - In patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type 1, processing of static tactile stimuli is impaired, whereas more complex sensory integration  functions appear preserved. This study investigated higher order multisensory  integration of body-relevant stimuli using the rubber hand illusion in CRPS  patients. Subjective self-reports and skin conductance responses to watching the  rubber hand being harmed were compared among CRPS patients (N=24), patients with  upper limb pain of other origin (N=21, clinical control group), and healthy  subjects (N=24). Additionally, the influence of body representation (body  plasticity [Trinity Assessment of Body Plasticity], neglect-like severity  symptoms), and clinical signs of illusion strength were investigated. For  statistical analysis, 1-way analysis of variance, t test, Pearson correlation,  with α=0.05 were used. CRPS patients did not differ from healthy subjects and the  control group with regard to their illusion strength as assessed by subjective  reports or skin conductance response values. Stronger left-sided rubber hand  illusions were reported by healthy subjects and left-side-affected CRPS patients.  Moreover, for this subgroup, illness duration and illusion strength were  negatively correlated. Overall, severity of neglect-like symptoms and clinical  signs were not related to illusion strength. However, patients with CRPS of the  right hand reported significantly stronger neglect-like symptoms and  significantly lower illusion strength of the affected hand than patients with  CRPS of the left hand. The weaker illusion of CRPS patients with strong  neglect-like symptoms on the affected hand supports the role of top-down  processes modulating body ownership. Moreover, the intact ability to perceive  illusory ownership confirms the notion that, despite impaired processing of  proprioceptive or tactile input, higher order multisensory integration is  unaffected in CRPS.

AB  - Acupuncture is a complex treatment comprising multisensory stimulation, including visual and tactile sensations and experiences of body ownership. The purpose of  this study was to investigate the role of these three components of acupuncture  stimulation in acupuncture analgesia. 40 healthy volunteers participated in the  study and received acupuncture treatment under three different conditions  (real-hand, rubber-hand synchronous, and rubber-hand asynchronous). The tolerance  for heat pain stimuli was measured before and after treatment. Brain oscillation  changes were also measured using electroencephalography (EEG). The pain tolerance  was significantly increased after acupuncture treatment under all three  conditions. Noticeable deqi (needle) sensations in response to acupuncture  stimulation of the rubber hand were found under both rubber-hand synchronous and  rubber-hand asynchronous conditions. Deqi sensations were significantly  correlated with acupuncture analgesia only under the rubber-hand synchronous  condition. Increased delta and decreased theta, alpha, beta, and gamma waves were  observed after acupuncture treatment under all three conditions. Our findings  clarified the role of cognitive components of acupuncture treatment in  acupuncture analgesia through the rubber-hand illusion. This study is a first  step toward separating various components of acupuncture analgesia, i.e. visual,  tactile, and body ownership, and utilizing those components to maximize analgesic  effects.

AB  - Illusory body resizing typically uses multisensory integration to change the perceived size of a body part. Previous studies associate these multisensory body  illusions with frontal theta oscillations and parietal gamma oscillations for  dis-integration and integration of multisensory signals, respectively. However,  recent studies also support illusory changes of embodiment from unimodal visual  stimuli. This preregistered study (N = 48) investigated differences between  multisensory visuo-tactile and unimodal visual resizing illusions using EEG, to  gain a more comprehensive understanding of the neural underpinnings of resizing  illusions in a healthy population. We hypothesised (1) stronger illusion in  multisensory compared to unimodal, and unimodal compared to incongruent  (dis-integration) conditions, (2) greater parietal gamma during multisensory  compared to unimodal, and (3) greater frontal theta during incongruent compared  to baseline conditions. Subjective Illusory results partially support Hypothesis  1, showing a stronger illusion in multisensory compared to unimodal conditions,  but finding no significant difference comparing unimodal to incongruent  conditions. Results partially supported EEG hypotheses, finding increased  parietal gamma activity comparing multisensory to unimodal visual conditions,  happening at a later stage of the illusion when compared to previous rubber hand  illusion EEG findings, whilst also finding increased parietal theta activity when  comparing incongruent to non-illusion conditions. While results demonstrated that  only 27% of participants experienced the stretching illusion with unimodal visual  stimuli compared to 73% of participants experiencing the stretching illusion in  the multisensory condition, further analysis suggested that those who experience  visual-only illusions exhibit a different neural signature to those who do not,  with activity focussed around frontal and parietal regions early on in the  illusory manipulation, compared to activity focussed more over parietal regions  and at a later point in the illusory manipulation for the full sample of  participants. Our results replicate previous subjective experience findings and  support the importance of multisensory integration for illusory changes in  perceived body size, whilst adding to our understanding of the temporal onset of  multisensory integration within resizing illusions, differing from that of rubber  hand illusions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is a well-established method for studying body ownership: Given adequate concordance of visual, sensory, and  proprioceptive stimuli, the individual experiences a rubber hand as his or her  own. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of a threat to the rubber hand. METHODS: We  created a typical RHI paradigm but added threatening pain: Both the real hand of  an individual and the rubber hand were stroked with a brush, either synchronously  (RHI-inducing condition) or asynchronously (control condition), but only the  rubber hand was then pricked with a needle to create a threatening pain  condition. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in a group of 23  typically-developed individuals. ERP effects were source-localized using  low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. RESULTS: The individuals consistently  reported experience of the RHI during the experiment when the brush strokes were  applied synchronously to both the real hand and the rubber hand. ERP analysis  revealed that synchronous brush stroking gave rise to higher amplitude of frontal  ERPs in the 100-200 ms range than asynchronous brush stroking, which was  interpreted as reflecting the RHI. In the threatening pain condition, ERPs showed  a greater positivity at frontocentral electrodes, source localized in the  supplementary motor area (SMA). CONCLUSION: SMA activation could reflect a  control mechanism over reflexive motor activity, facilitating a possible  threat-related response. Further studies should address ERP effects and the  extent of the RHI to standard and threat stimuli in a correlative fashion to  further elucidate the functional significance of the neurophysiological findings.

AB  - Recent research has begun to investigate sensory processing in relation to nonclinical variation in traits associated with the autism spectrum disorders  (ASD). We propose that existing accounts of autistic perception can be augmented  by considering a role for individual differences in top-down expectations for the  precision of sensory input, related to the processing of state-dependent levels  of uncertainty. We therefore examined ASD-like traits in relation to the  rubber-hand illusion: an experimental paradigm that typically elicits crossmodal  integration of visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information in an unusual  illusory context. Individuals with higher ASD-like traits showed reduced effects  of the rubber-hand illusion on perceived arm position and reach-to-grasp  movements, compared to individuals with lower ASD-like traits. These differences  occurred despite both groups reporting the typical subjective experience of the  illusion concerning visuotactile integration and ownership for the rubber hand.  Together these results suggest that the integration of proprioceptive information  with cues for arm position derived from the illusory context differs between  individuals partly in relation to traits associated with ASD. We suggest that the  observed differences in sensory integration can be best explained in terms of  differing expectations regarding the precision of sensory estimates in contexts  that suggest uncertainty.

AB  - This review summarizes the clinical development of a family of ultra-rapid-acting recombinant human insulin formulations. These formulations use  ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to chelate zinc and thereby destabilize  insulin hexamers. In addition, insulin monomer surface charges are chemically  masked with citrate to prevent reaggregation. The first phase 1 trials were  performed using BIOD-090, an acidic 25 unit U/ml insulin formulation, which  contained disodium-EDTA (NaEDTA). When compared with regular human insulin (RHI)  and/or insulin lispro in multiple phase 1 studies, BIOD-090 consistently showed  more rapid absorption and/or onset of action. A standard meal challenge study  also demonstrated improved postprandial glucose profiles associated with  BIOD-090. However, increased patient exposure in larger phase 3 trials showed  that this formulation was associated with an increased incidence of local  injection site reactions, most commonly pain. A next generation formulation,  BIOD-100, contained the same excipients as a standard insulin concentration of  100 U/ml. BIOD-100 maintained an ultra-rapid action profile and was associated  with modest but significantly improved toleration when compared with BIOD-090. In  order to further improve toleration, the hypothesis that NaEDTA contributed to  discomfort by chelating endogenous calcium was tested by either substituting  calcium-EDTA for NaEDTA or by adding calcium chloride to the NaEDTA formulation.  These calcium formulations essentially eliminated the excess discomfort  associated with BIOD-090 but were associated with less optimal pharmacokinetic  profiles in humans. Recent efforts have succeeded in developing  ultra-rapid-acting human insulin formulations with acceptable injection site  toleration by optimizing concentrations of calcium (BIOD-125) and with the use of  magnesium sulfate to mitigate discomfort (BIOD-123). Similar formulation  technology has also been shown to accelerate absorption of insulin analogs in  animal models.

AB  - Next to neurogenic inflammation and pathological sympathetic-afferent coupling, functional imaging studies have shown the crucial role of maladaptive cortical  reorgansation in the pathophysiology of CRPS. Bilateral neuroplastic alterations  in the somatosensory cortex seem to play a substantial role in the dysfunctional  sensory processing of stimuli. The aim was to investigate the multimodal  integration of sensory and visual stimuli into the body scheme and the influence  of higher cognitive body representation in the integration of multimodal schema,  body relevant stimuli in patients with CRPS. The investigated sample included 24  patients suffering from CRPS of the upper extremities, 21 patients with chronic  hand pain of other origins and 24 healthy probands. The rubber hand illusion was  carried out for the first time in patients with complex regional pain syndrome  (CRPS). The reprentations show that the patients can integrate a rubber hand in  their body representation to the same degree as healthy patients. The intact  experience of the rubber hand illusion by CRPS patients indicates that the  integration of congruent visual and tactile stimuli in CRPS is intact.

AB  - Background. The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is an experimental paradigm that manipulates important aspects of body self-awareness. Objectives. We were  interested in whether modifying bodily self-awareness by manipulation of body  ownership and visual expectations using the RHI would change the subjective  perception of pain as well as the autonomic response to acupuncture needle  stimulation. Methods. Acupuncture needle stimulation was applied to the real hand  during the RHI with (experiment 1) or without (experiment 2) visual expectation  while measuring concurrent autonomic changes such as the skin conductance  response (SCR). Subjective responses such as perception of the RHI and perceived  pain were measured by questionnaires. Results. In experiment 1, the amplitude of  the increase in SCR was visibly higher during the synchronous session compared  with that of the asynchronous session. In experiment 2, the amplitude of the  increase of SCR was lower for the synchronous session compared with that for the  asynchronous session. Comparing these two experiments, the visual expectation of  needle stimulation produced a greater autonomic response to acupuncture  stimulation. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that the sympathetic response to  acupuncture needle stimulation is primarily influenced by visual expectation  rather than by modifications of body ownership.

AB  - Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a highly prevalent, chronic musculoskeletal condition characterized by widespread pain and evoked pain at tender points. This  study evaluated various aspects of body awareness in a sample of 14 women with  FMS and 13 healthy controls, such as plasticity of the body schema, body esteem,  and interoceptive awareness. To this end, the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI), the  Body Esteem Scale (BES), and the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ) were used,  respectively. Consistent with increased plasticity of the body schema, FMS  patients scored higher, with large or very large effect sizes, across all three  domains evaluated in the RHI paradigm, namely proprioceptive drift and perceived  ownership and motor control over the rubber hand. Scores on all items addressed  by the BES were consistently lower among FMS subjects (2.52, SEM .19 vs 3.89, SEM  .16, respectively, p < .01, Cohen's d = .38-.66). In the FMS sample, BES scores  assigned to most painful regions also were lower than those assigned to the  remaining body sites (1.58, SEM .19 vs 2.87, SEM .18, respectively, p < .01).  Significantly higher scores (p < .01, Cohen's d = .51-.87) were found in the FMS  sample across awareness (3.57 SEM .15 vs 1.87 SEM .11), stress response (3.76 SEM  .11 vs 1.78 SEM .11), autonomic nervous system reactivity (2.59 SEM .17 vs 1.35  SEM .07), and stress style 2 (2.73 SEM .27 vs 1.13 SEM .04) subscales of the BPQ.  Intensity of ongoing clinical pain was found to be strongly correlated with  interoceptive awareness (r = .75, p = .002). The results suggest a disturbed  embodiment in FMS, characterized by instability of the body schema, negatively  biased cognitions regarding one's own body, and increased vigilance to internal  bodily cues. These manifestations may be interpreted as related with the  inability of incoming sensory inputs to adequately update negatively biased  off-line somatorepresentations stored as long-term memory.

T2  - Psychophysiology
AB  - For some people, seeing pain in others triggers a pain-like experience in themselves: these experiences can either be described in sensory terms and  localized to specific body parts (sensory-localized, or S/L) or in affective  terms and nonlocalized or whole-body experiences (affective-general, or A/G). In  two studies, it is shown that these are linked to different clinical and  psychophysiological profiles relative to controls. Study 1 shows that the A/G  profile is linked to symptoms of Blood-Injection-Injury Phobia whereas the S/L  profile shows some tendency toward eating disorders. Study 2 shows that the A/G  profile is linked to poor interoceptive accuracy (for heartbeat detection)  whereas the S/L profile is linked to higher heart-rate variability (HRV) when  observing pain, which is typically regarded as an index of good autonomic emotion  regulation. Neither group showed significant differences in overall heart rate,  systolic blood pressure (SBP), or skin conductance response (SCR) when observing  pain, and no overall differences in state or trait anxiety. Overall, the research  points to different underlying mechanisms linked to different manifestations of  vicarious pain response. Affective-General pain responders have strong subjective  bodily experiences (likely of central origin given the absence of major  differences in autonomic responsiveness) coupled with a worse ability to read  objective interoceptive signals. Sensory-localized pain responders have  differences in their ability to construct a multi-sensory body schema (as  evidenced by prior research on the Rubber Hand Illusion) coupled with enhanced  cardiovagal (parasympathetic) reactivity often indicative of better stress  adaptation.

AB  - Background: Assessment of the endothelial function of the microvasculature by peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) has gained increasing popularity in  pediatrics. Discomfort or experienced pain during fingertip PAT has only been  studied in adolescents and adults. Methods: In 142 children (aged 4-11 years  old), a fingertip PAT with a commercial device (EndoPAT 2000®) as well as a  caliper and ultrasound examination of peripheral skinfolds were performed as part  of a cross-sectional cohort study. In 110 children, Faces Pain Scale (FPS-R) data  were collected after PAT and skinfold measurements by caliper and ultrasound.  Results: In 111 out of the 142 PAT measurements (78.2%), a reactive hyperemia  index (RHI) could be obtained. The most frequent error messages by the software  was a "too noisy" and/or a "poor quality" signal. The success rate was higher in  children aged older than 6 years (83.1 vs. 44.4%; p < 0.001). Median (range)  FPS-R after PAT was 0 (range 0-6) but was significantly higher than the median  pain experienced after caliper measurements of peripheral skinfolds (p < 0.001).  No pain was experienced by 59 of the 110 children (54.1%). Conclusion: PAT  testing is feasible in the great majority of school-aged children, and the  procedure is well-tolerated.

AB  - Seeing one's own body has been reported to have analgesic properties. Analgesia has also been described when seeing an embodied virtual body colocated with the  real one. However, there is controversy regarding whether this effect holds true  when seeing an illusory-owned body part, such as during the rubber-hand illusion.  A critical difference between these paradigms is the distance between the real  and surrogate body part. Colocation of the real and surrogate arm is possible in  an immersive virtual environment, but not during illusory ownership of a rubber  arm. The present study aimed at testing whether the distance between a real and a  virtual arm can explain such differences in terms of pain modulation. Using a  paradigm of embodiment of a virtual body allowed us to evaluate heat pain  thresholds at colocation and at a 30-cm distance between the real and the virtual  arm. We observed a significantly higher heat pain threshold at colocation than at  a 30-cm distance. The analgesic effects of seeing a virtual colocated arm were  eliminated by increasing the distance between the real and the virtual arm, which  explains why seeing an illusorily owned rubber arm does not consistently result  in analgesia. These findings are relevant for the use of virtual reality in pain  management. PERSPECTIVE: Looking at a virtual body has analgesic properties  similar to looking at one's real body. We identify the importance of colocation  between a real and a surrogate body for this to occur and thereby resolve a  scientific controversy. This information is useful for exploiting immersive  virtual reality in pain management.

AB  - The rubber hand illusion is an experimental paradigm in which participants consider a fake hand to be part of their body. This paradigm has been used in  many domains of psychology (i.e., research on pain, body ownership, agency) and  is of clinical importance. The classic rubber hand paradigm nevertheless suffers  from limitations, such as the absence of active motion or the reliance on  approximate measurements, which makes strict experimental conditions difficult to  obtain. Here, we report on the development of a novel technology-a robotic, user-  and computer-controllable hand-that addresses many of the limitations associated  with the classic rubber hand paradigm. Because participants can actively control  the robotic hand, the device affords higher realism and authenticity. Our robotic  hand has a comparatively low cost and opens up novel and innovative methods. In  order to validate the robotic hand, we have carried out three experiments. The  first two studies were based on previous research using the rubber hand, while  the third was specific to the robotic hand. We measured both sense of agency and  ownership. Overall, results show that participants experienced a "robotic hand  illusion" in the baseline conditions. Furthermore, we also replicated previous  results about agency and ownership.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain presents a significant treatment challenge, often leading to frustration for both patients and therapists due to the limitations of  traditional methods. Research has shown that synchronous visuo-tactile  stimulation, as used in the rubber hand experiment, can induce a sense of  ownership over a fake body part and reduces pain perception when ownership of the  fake body part is reported. The effect of the rubber hand experiment can be  extended to the full body, for example, during the full-body illusion, using both  visuo-tactile and cardiovisual signals. OBJECTIVE: This study first aimed to  evaluate the usability and accuracy of a novel, mobile virtual reality (VR) setup  that displays participants' heartbeats as a flashing silhouette on a virtual  avatar, a technique known as the cardiovisual full-body illusion. The second part  of the study investigated the effects of synchronous cardiovisual stimulation on  pain perception and ownership in 20 healthy participants as compared with  asynchronous stimulation (control condition). METHODS: The setup comprised a  head-mounted display (HMD) and a heart rate measurement device. A  smartphone-based HMD (Samsung Galaxy S8+) was selected for its mobility, and  heart rates were measured using smartwatches with photoplethysmography (PPG). The  accuracy of 2 smartwatch positions was compared with a 5-point electrocardiogram  (ECG) standard in terms of their accuracy (number and percent of missed beats).  Each participant underwent two 5-minute sessions of synchronous cardiovisual  stimulation and two 5-minute sessions of asynchronous cardiovisual stimulation  (total of 4 sessions), followed by pain assessments. Usability, symptoms of  cybersickness, and ownership of the virtual body were measured using established  questionnaires (System Usability Scale, Simulator Sickness Questionnaire,  Ownership Questionnaire). Pain perception was assessed using advanced algometric  methods (Algopeg and Somedic algometer). RESULTS: Results demonstrated high  usability scores (mean 4.42, SD 0.56; out of 5), indicating ease of use and  acceptance, with minimal side effects (mean 1.18, SD 0.46; out of a possible 4  points on the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire). The PPG device showed high heart  rate measurement precision, which improved with optimized filtering and peak  detection algorithms. However, compared with previous work, no significant  effects on body ownership and pain perception were observed between the  synchronous and asynchronous conditions. These findings are discussed in the  context of existing literature on VR interventions for chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS:  In conclusion, while the new VR setup showed high usability and minimal side  effects, it did not significantly affect ownership or pain perception. This  highlights the need for further research to refine VR-based interventions for  chronic pain management, considering factors like visual realism and perspective.

AB  - Following the amputation of a limb, many amputees report that they can still vividly perceive its presence despite conscious knowledge that it is not  physically there. However, our ability to probe the mental representation of this  experience is limited by the intractable and often distressing pain associated  with amputation. Here, we present a method for eliciting phantom-like experiences  in non-amputees using a variation of the rubber hand illusion in which a finger  has been removed from the rubber hand. An interpretative phenomenological  analysis revealed that the structure of this experience shares a wide range of  sensory attributes with subjective reports of phantom limb experience. For  example, when the space where the ring finger should have been on the rubber hand  was stroked, 93% of participants (i.e., 28/30) reported the vivid presence of a  finger that they could not see and a total of 57% (16/28) of participants who  felt that the finger was present reported one or more additional sensory  qualities such as tingling or numbness (25%; 7/28) and alteration in the  perceived size of the finger (50%; 14/28). These experiences indicate the  adaptability of body experience and share some characteristics of the way that  phantom limbs are described. Participants attributed changes to the shape and  size of their "missing" finger to the way in which the experimenter mimed  stroking in the area occupied by the missing finger. This alteration of body  perception is similar to the phenomenon of telescoping experienced by people with  phantom limbs and suggests that our sense of embodiment not only depends on  internal body representations but on perceptual information coming from  peripersonal space.

AB  - Based on visuo-tactile stimulation, the rubber hand illusion induces a sense of ownership for a dummy hand. Manipulating the visibility of the dummy hand during  the stimulation influences cognitive aspects of the illusion, suggesting that the  related brain activity may be influenced too. To test this, we analyzed brain  activity (fMRI), subjective ratings, and skin conductance from 45 neurotypical  participants undergoing a modified rubber hand illusion protocol where we  manipulated the visibility (high, medium, and low) of a virtual hand, not the  brush (virtual hand illusion; VHI). To further investigate the impact of  visibility manipulations on VHI-related secondary effects (i.e. vicarious  somatosensation), we recorded brain activity and skin conductance during a  vicarious pain protocol (observation of painful stimulations of the virtual hand)  that occurred after the VHI procedure. Results showed that, during both the VHI  and vicarious pain periods, the activity of distinct visual, somatosensory, and  motor brain regions was modulated by (i) visibility manipulations, (ii) coherence  between visual and tactile stimulation, and (iii) time of visuo-tactile  stimulation. Accordingly, embodiment-related subjective ratings of the perceived  illusion were specifically influenced by visibility manipulations. These findings  suggest that visibility modifications can impact the neural and cognitive effects  of illusory body ownership, in that when visibility decreases the illusion is  perceived as weaker and the brain activity in visual, motor, and somatosensory  regions is overall lower. We interpret this evidence as a sign of the weight of  vision on embodiment processes, in that the cortical and subjective aspects of  illusory body ownership are weakened by a degradation of visual input during the  induction of the illusion.

AB  - In the rubber hand illusion (RHI), individuals perceive a fake hand as their own when the hidden real hand and visible fake hand are synchronously stroked.  Several RHI studies have reported that visual manipulation of the embodied fake  hand inversely affects the perceptual processing of the observer's own hand  (e.g., thermal or pain sensitivity). In this study, we examined whether motor  manipulation of the fake hand similarly affects the observer's motor system. Our  study employed a novel RHI paradigm wherein stroking was interrupted by  unexpected movement of the fake hand (i.e., finger spreading) while measuring  electroencephalography (EEG). We found that participants often spontaneously  moved their hands in accordance with the movement of the fake hand only in the  RHI (synchronous) sessions. EEG analyses revealed enhanced neural activation  (mu-rhythm desynchronization) of the motor system during observation of the fake  hand movement. Moreover, motor activation was greater in the synchronous than in  the asynchronous condition and significantly correlated with the feeling of body  ownership over the fake hand. These findings provide strong behavioral and  neurophysiological evidence of 'motor back projection', in which the movement of  an illusory embodied body part is inversely transferred to the sensorimotor  system of the observer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at developing an experimental paradigm to assess vicarious pain experiences. We further explored the putative moderating role of  observer's characteristics such as hypervigilance for pain and dispositional  empathy. METHODS: Two experiments are reported using a similar procedure.  Undergraduate students were selected based upon whether they reported vicarious  pain in daily life, and categorized into a pain responder group or a comparison  group. Participants were presented a series of videos showing hands being pricked  whilst receiving occasionally pricking (electrocutaneous) stimuli themselves. In  congruent trials, pricking and visual stimuli were applied to the same spatial  location. In incongruent trials, pricking and visual stimuli were in the opposite  spatial location. Participants were required to report on which location they  felt a pricking sensation. Of primary interest was the effect of viewing another  in pain upon vicarious pain errors, i.e., the number of trials in which an  illusionary sensation was reported. Furthermore, we explored the effect of  individual differences in hypervigilance to pain, dispositional empathy and the  rubber hand illusion (RHI) upon vicarious pain errors. RESULTS: RESULTS of both  experiments indicated that the number of vicarious pain errors was overall low.  In line with expectations, the number of vicarious pain errors was higher in the  pain responder group than in the comparison group. Self-reported hypervigilance  for pain lowered the probability of reporting vicarious pain errors in the pain  responder group, but dispositional empathy and the RHI did not. CONCLUSION: Our  paradigm allows measuring vicarious pain experiences in students. However, the  prevalence of vicarious experiences of pain is low, and only a small percentage  of participants display the phenomenon. It remains however unknown which  variables affect its occurrence.

T2  - Scientific reports
AB  - Previous research revealed an active network of brain areas such as insula and anterior cingulate cortex when witnessing somebody else in pain and feeling  empathy. But numerous studies also suggested a role of the somatosensory cortices  for state and trait empathy. While recent studies highlight the role of the  observer's primary somatosensory cortex when seeing painful or nonpainful touch,  the interaction of somatosensory cortex activity with empathy when receiving  touch on the own body is unknown. The current study examines the relationship of  touch related somatosensory cortex activity with dispositional empathy by  employing an fMRI approach. Participants were touched on the palm of the hand  either by the hand of an experimenter or by a rubber hand. We found that the BOLD  responses in the primary somatosensory cortex were associated with empathy  personality traits personal distress and perspective taking. This relationship  was observed when participants were touched both with the experimenter's real  hand or a rubber hand. What is the reason for this link between touch perception  and trait empathy? We argue that more empathic individuals may express stronger  attention both to other's human perceptions as well as to the own sensations. In  this way, higher dispositional empathy levels might enhance tactile processing by  top-down processes. We discuss possible implications of these findings.

AB  - Many upper limb amputees experience an incessant, post-amputation "phantom limb pain" and report that their missing limbs feel paralyzed in an uncomfortable  posture. One hypothesis is that efferent commands no longer generate expected  afferent signals, such as proprioceptive feedback from changes in limb  configuration, and that the mismatch of motor commands and visual feedback is  interpreted as pain. Non-invasive therapeutic techniques for treating phantom  limb pain, such as mirror visual feedback (MVF), rely on visualizations of  postural changes. Advances in neural interfaces for artificial sensory feedback  now make it possible to combine MVF with a high-tech "rubber hand" illusion, in  which subjects develop a sense of embodiment with a fake hand when subjected to  congruent visual and somatosensory feedback. We discuss clinical benefits that  could arise from the confluence of known concepts such as MVF and the rubber hand  illusion, and new technologies such as neural interfaces for sensory feedback and  highly sensorized robot hand testbeds, such as the "BairClaw" presented here. Our  multi-articulating, anthropomorphic robot testbed can be used to study  proprioceptive and tactile sensory stimuli during physical finger-object  interactions. Conceived for artificial grasp, manipulation, and haptic  exploration, the BairClaw could also be used for future studies on the  neurorehabilitation of somatosensory disorders due to upper limb impairment or  loss. A remote actuation system enables the modular control of tendon-driven  hands. The artificial proprioception system enables direct measurement of joint  angles and tendon tensions while temperature, vibration, and skin deformation are  provided by a multimodal tactile sensor. The provision of multimodal sensory  feedback that is spatiotemporally consistent with commanded actions could lead to  benefits such as reduced phantom limb pain, and increased prosthesis use due to  improved functionality and reduced cognitive burden.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leukoaraiosis (LA), as an age-related white matter degeneration, is mainly caused by chronic ischemia. Our study aims to explore the efficacy of  different doses of atorvastatin (ATV) in the vascular endothelial function in  patients with LA. METHODS: Our study enrolled 402 LA patients who were then  randomly included as control or treated with ATV (10 mg), ATV (20 mg), or ATV  (30 mg). The total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were  detected by enzyme colorimetric assay. The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein  (hs-CRP) level, reactive hyperemia index (RHI), endothelin-1 (ET-1) content, and  nitric oxide (NO) level were tested by latex agglutination test, peripheral  arterial tonometry technology, radioimmunoassay, and nitrate reductase assay,  respectively. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of ATV treatment, the levels of TC, LDL-C,  and HS-CRP decreased significantly, and the trends were demonstrated in a more  significant way with the increases of dose of ATV. The treatment with ATV at  different doses elevated NO level and RHI and declined ET-1 content.  Gastrointestinal reaction, muscular pain, and increased aminopherase were  observed after treatment with the ATV at different doses with more obvious  symptoms detected accompanied by the increase of the dose. The RHI was in  negative correlation with the ET-1 and HS-CRP while in positive correlation with  NO. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that ATV can significantly improve the  vascular endothelial function in LA patients with a dose-dependent effect.

AB  - Some chronic pain patients and healthy individuals experience pain when observing injury or others in pain. To further understand shared pain, we investigated  perspective taking, bodily ownership and tooth pain sensitivity. First,  participants who reported shared pain (responders) and those who did not  (non-responders) viewed an avatar on a screen. Intermittently, 0-3 circles  appeared. Sometimes the participant's and avatar's perspective were consistent,  both directly viewed the same circles, and sometimes inconsistent, both directly  viewed different circles. Responders were faster than non-responders to identify  the number of circles when adopting a consistent perspective. Second,  participants sat with their left hand hidden while viewing a rubber hand. All  participants reported an illusory sensation of feeling stroking in the rubber  hand and a sense of ownership of the rubber hand during synchronous stroking of  the rubber and hidden hand. The responders also reported feeling the stroking and  a sense of ownership of the rubber hand during asynchronous stroking. For  experiment three, participants with either low, moderate, or high tooth  sensitivity observed a series of images depicting someone eating an ice-popsicle.  Low sensitivity participants never reported pain. In contrast, moderate and high  sensitivity participants reported pain in response to an image depicting someone  eating an ice popsicle (4 and 19% of the time, respectively) and depicting  someone eating an ice-popsicle and expressing pain (23 and 40%, respectively). In  summary, responders have reduced ability to distinguish their own and others'  visual perspective and enhanced ability to integrate a foreign arm into their  bodily representation. The tendency to share pain is also enhanced when an  observed pain is commonly experienced by the observer. Shared pain may therefore  involve reactivation of pain memories or pain schema that are readily integrated  into a self perspective and bodily representation.

T2  - Neuropsychologia
AB  - There is an important link between pain, regulation of body temperature, and body ownership. For example, an altered feeling of body ownership - due to either  chronic pain or "rubber-hand illusions" (RHI) - is associated with reduced  temperature of the affected limb. However, the causal relationships within this  triad are not well understood. We therefore investigated whether external  manipulation of body temperature can influence body ownership. We used a thermode  to make the right hand of healthy participants either painfully cold, cool,  neutral, warm or painfully hot. Next, we induced the RHI and investigated its  effects on the perceived position of the hand, on the subjective feeling of body  ownership, and on physical changes in hand temperature. We replicate previous  reports that inducing the RHI produces a decrease in limb temperature.  Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time a causal effect in the opposite  direction. Cooling down the participant's hand increased the strength of the RHI,  while warming the hand externally decreased the strength of the RHI. Finally, we  show that the painful extremes of these temperatures do not modulate the RHI.  Hence, while thermosensation is an important driver of body ownership, pain seems  to bypass the multisensory mechanisms of embodiment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ropivacaine oil delivery depot (RODD) can slowly release ropivacaine and block nerves for a long timejavascript:;. The aim of the present  work was to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary  pharmacodynamics of RODD in subcutaneous injection among healthy subjects.  METHODS: The abdomens of 3 subjects were subcutaneously administered with a  single-needle RODD containing 12~30 mg of ropivacaine. The irritation, nerve  blocking range and optimum dose were investigated. Forty-one subjects were  divided into RODD groups containing 150, 230, 300, 350 and 400 mg of ropivacaine  and a ropivacaine hydrochloride injection (RHI) 150 mg group. Multineedle  subcutaneous injection of RODD or RHI was performed in the abdomens of the  subjects. The primary endpoint was a safe dose or a maximum dose of ropivacaine  (400 mg). Subjects' vital signs were observed; their blood was analyzed; their  cardiovascular system and nervous systems were monitored, and their  dermatological reactions were observed and scored. Second, the ropivacaine  concentrations in plasma were determined, pharmacokinetic parameters were  calculated, and the anesthetic effects of RODD were studied, including RODD onset  time, duration and intensity of nerve block. RESULTS: Single-needle injection of  RODD 24 mg was optimal for 3 subjects, and the range of nerve block was 42.5±20.8  mm. Multineedle subcutaneous injection of RODD in the abdomens of subjects was  safe, and all adverse events were no more severe than grade II. The incidence  rate of grade II adverse events, such as pain, and abnormal ST and ST-T segment  changes on electrocardiography, was approximately 1%. The incidence rate of grade  I adverse events, including erythema, papules, hypertriglyceridemia, and  hypotension was greater than 10%. Erythema and papules were relieved after 24 h  and disappeared after 72 h. Other adverse reactions disappeared after 7 days. The  curve of ropivacaine concentration-time in plasma presented a bimodal profile.  The results showed that ropivacaine was slowly released from the RODD. Compared  with the 150 mg RHI group, Tmax was longer in the RODD groups. In particular,  Tmax in the 400 mg RODD group was longer than that in the RHI group (11.8±4.6 h  vs. 0.77±0.06 h). The Cmax in the 150 mg RODD group was lower than that in the  150 mg RHI group (0.35±0.09 vs. 0.58±0.13 μg·mL-1). In particular, the Cmax  increased by 48% when the dose was increased by 2.6 times in the 400 mg group.  Cmax, the AUC value and the intensity of the nerve block increased with  increasing doses of RODD. Among them, the 400 mg RODD group presented the  strongest nerve block (the percentage of level 2 and 3, 42.9%). The corresponding  median onset time was 0.42 h, and the duration median was 35.7⁓47.7 h.  CONCLUSIONS: RODD has a sustained release effect. Compared with the RHI group,  Tmax was delayed in the RODD groups, and the duration of nerve block was long. No  abnormal reaction was found in the RODD group containing 400 mg of ropivacaine  after subcutaneous injection among healthy subjects, suggesting that RODD was  adequately safe.

TI  - The manipulation of top-down interpretation as one's symptomatic body reduces the sense of body ownership.
AU  - Yamamoto, Kazuki

T2  - Frontiers in psychology
AB  - Sense of body ownership has been studied using rubber hand illusion (RHI) and full-body illusion (FBI). It has recently become clear that consciously  interpreting a fake body as one's own in a top-down manner influences these body  illusions. Furthermore, a study interestingly found that the influence of  top-down interpretation was moderated by the degree of depersonalization, which  was a symptom of a lack of sense of body ownership. In a case study on  depersonalization, the top-down interpretation of one's body was suggested to be  a negative physical state that made it difficult to feel a sense of body  ownership. However, this has not been examined. We examined the influence of  negative top-down interpretation using an FBI procedure. A fake body was  instructed to be viewed as a negative self-body ("view the virtual body's back  while regarding the virtual body as your own experiencing abdominal pain"). To  examine the influence of a negative top-down interpretation, participants were  instructed to interpret the body as their own (neutral self-body) as a control  condition. We used skin conductance responses to a fearful stimulus presented  after an illusion procedure to measure the degree of FBI experienced. Results  indicated a significant difference in the skin conductance response between the  synchronous and asynchronous presentation of visual-tactile stimuli in the  control condition, which confirmed the occurrence of the illusion. However, the  occurrence of the illusion was not confirmed when the participants were  instructed to interpret the virtual body as their own in a negative physical  state, and the degree of FBI was smaller than the control condition. Our finding  that an FBI was inhibited by manipulation of the top-down interpretation  suggested that it could be a factor that inhibited the creation of a sense of  body ownership.

AB  - We examined changes in pain sensitivity in the rubber hand illusion (RHI). Experiment 1 investigated changes in pain tolerance immediately after a "healthy"  and "wounded" RHI when immersing the hand in a cold pressor ice bath. There was  19% increased pain tolerance and increased perception detection threshold after  the healthy RHI, but 11% reduction after the wounded RHI. Experiment 2 examined  pain experience during the wounded RHI with capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia. Pain  intensity and unpleasantness was higher on the illusion arm during the  synchronous RHI, compared with asynchronous trials. There was no change in pain  experience on the control arm, and both arms had similar pain sensitivity after  the experiment. Our results highlight the impact of embodying a substitute limb  on pain, with increased tolerance and reduced tactile sensitivity when the fake  limb is healthy and apparently pain-free, but increased pain sensitivity when the  self-attributed limb appears to be wounded.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of exercise on the microvasculature of patients with suspected coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), assessed by reactive  hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT; EndoPAT), is unknown. The  present study aimed to determine if standard clinical exercise stress testing  (GXT) affected peripheral microvascular function, as determined by the reactive  hyperemia index (RHI and LnRHI), in patients with suspected CMD. METHODS: In a  cross-sectional study, patients (n = 76) were grouped based on whether the GXT  was performed; 1) prior to (exercisers; n = 30), or 2) after the vascular  assessment (non-exercisers; n = 46). Patients with an adenosine index of  microvascular resistance > 25, adenosine coronary flow reserve (CFR) < 2.0,  and/or acetylcholine CFR < 1.5 were considered to have CMD (n = 42). RHI and  LnRHI quantified finger pulse amplitude hyperemia following 5 min of forearm  ischemia. RESULTS: LnRHI was lower in patients with CMD compared to patients  without CMD, while LnRHI was also lower in exercisers compared to non-exercisers  (LnRHI: CMD Non-Exercisers: 0.63 ± 0.25; CMD Exercisers: 0.54 ± 0.19; No CMD  Non-Exercisers: 0.85 ± 0.23; No CMD Exercisers: 0.63 ± 0.26; Condition and  Exercise Main Effects: Both P < 0.01). In patients who did not exercise prior to  the vascular assessment, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for  LnRHI to predict CMD was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.62-0.91; P < 0.01). However, in patients  who performed exercise prior to the vascular assessment, the ROC for LnRHI to  predict CMD was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.40-0.81; P = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: CMD is  associated with impaired peripheral microvascular function and preceding acute  exercise is associated with further reductions of LnRHI. Further, acute exercise  abolished the capacity for RH-PAT to predict the presence of CMD in patients with  chest pain and non-obstructive coronary arteries. RH-PAT measurements in patients  with suspected CMD should not be conducted after exercise has been performed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated whether digital reactive hyperemia index (RHI) measured by digital pulse amplitude tonometry is a sensitive indicator of  coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD). BACKGROUND: CMD is an early marker of  cardiovascular disease. However, CMD is a complex diagnosis and consists of  multiple abnormalities of the coronary circulation. Impaired RHI is a noninvasive  measure of peripheral vascular dysfunction that can identify individuals with  acetylcholine induced coronary vascular dysfunction. It is largely unknown  whether there is also an association between RHI and the endothelial-independent  aspect of CMD assessed as a coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR). METHODS: We  included 339 women with chest pain suggestive of angina pectoris and a diagnostic  invasive coronary angiogram without significant coronary artery stenosis (<50%).  CFVR was measured by transthoracic pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography during  dipyridamole infusion (0.84 mg/kg). RHI was assessed by digital pulse amplitude  tonometry. Participants were categorized in 3 RHI and 3 CFVR groups. We examined  the association between CFVR and RHI and the distribution of cardiovascular risk  factors between the CFVR and RHI groups. RESULTS: CFVR and RHI were successfully  measured in 322 participants. Median CFVR was 2.3 (interquartile range: 2.0 to  2.8) and median RHI was 2.1 (interquartile range: 1.6 to 2.6). No correlation was  found between CFVR and RHI (Spearman's rho = -0.067, p = 0.23), and mean RHI did  not differ between CFVR categories (p = 0.39). Participants with low CFVR were  significantly older and had a significantly greater burden of hypertension,  whereas participants with an impaired RHI had a higher body mass index and were  more likely to have diabetes and be current smokers. CONCLUSIONS: RHI does not  identify individuals with CMD assessed as impaired CFVR by dipyridamole stress  echocardiography in women with no obstructive coronary artery disease. The two  methods are likely to identify different aspects of vascular pathology, as  indicated by the different association with cardiovascular risk factors.

T2  - Military medicine
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Military service members (SMs) are exposed to repetitive head impacts (RHIs) in combat and training that are purported to adversely affect  brain health, including cognition, behavior, and function. Researchers have  reported that RHI from blast-related exposure may affect both vestibular and  ocular function, which in turn may be related to symptomology. As such, an  examination of the effects of RHI on exposed military SMs should incorporate  these domains. To date, researchers have not compared groups of exposed special  operations forces (SOF) operators on combined clinical vestibular/ocular and  eye-tracker-based outcomes. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to  compare participant-reported symptoms and performance on the Vestibular/Ocular  Motor Screening (VOMS) tool with performance on the computerized RightEye  tracking system between SOF operators exposed to blast-related RHI and healthy  controls without blast-related exposure. In addition, the study aimed to compare  subgroups of snipers and breachers exposed to RHI to controls on the preceding  metrics, as well as identify a subset of individual (demographic) factors,  participant-reported symptoms, and performance metrics on VOMS and RightEye that  best identify SOF operators exposed to RHI from unexposed controls. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: The study involved a cross-sectional design including 25 Canadian SOF  SMs comprised of breachers (n = 9), snipers (n = 9), and healthy, unexposed  controls (n = 7). The former 2 groups were combined into an RHI group (n = 18)  and compared to controls (n = 7). Participants provided demographics and  completed a self-reported concussion-related symptom report via the Military  Acute Concussion Evaluation 2, the VOMS, and RightEye computerized eye-tracking  assessments. Independent samples t-tests and ANOVAs were used to compare the  groups on the outcomes, with receiver operating characteristic curve and area  under the curve (AUC) analyses to identify predictors of blast exposure. This  study was approved by the Defence Research Development Canada Human Research  Ethics Committee and the Canadian Forces Surgeon General/Special Forces Command.  RESULTS: The results from t-tests supported group differences for age (P = .012),  participant-reported symptoms (P = .006), and all VOMS items (P  range = <.001-.02), with the RHI group being higher than healthy controls on all  variables. ANOVA results supported group differences among snipers, breachers,  and controls for age (P = .01), RightEye saccades (P = .04), participant-reported  total symptom severity (P = .03), and VOMS total scores (P = .003). The results  of the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses supported age  (AUC = 0.81), Military Acute Concussion Evaluation 2 participant-reported total  symptom severity (AUC = 0.87), and VOMS total scores (AUC = 0.92) as significant  predictors of prior blast exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Participant-reported concussion  symptoms, VOMS scores, and age were useful in identifying SOF operators exposed  to RHI from controls. RightEye metrics were not useful in differentiating RHI  groups from controls. Differences between snipers and breachers warrant further  research. Overall, the findings suggest that VOMS may be a useful tool for  screening for the effects of exposure to RHI in SOF operators. Future  investigations should be conducted on a larger sample of military SMs, consider  additional factors (e.g., RHI exposure levels, medical history, and sex), and  include additional assessment domains (e.g., balance, cognitive, and  psychological).

AB  - Social contact is essential for survival in human society. A previous study demonstrated that interpersonal contact alleviates pain-related distress by  suppressing the activity of its underlying neural network. One explanation for  this is that attention is shifted from the cause of distress to interpersonal  contact. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a functional MRI (fMRI) study  wherein eight pairs of close female friends rated the aversiveness of aversive  and non-aversive visual stimuli under two conditions: joining hands either with a  rubber model (rubber-hand condition) or with a close friend (human-hand  condition). Subsequently, participants rated the overall comfortableness of each  condition. The rating result after fMRI indicated that participants experienced  greater comfortableness during the human-hand compared to the rubber-hand  condition, whereas aversiveness ratings during fMRI were comparable across  conditions. The fMRI results showed that the two conditions commonly produced  aversive-related activation in both sides of the visual cortex (including V1, V2,  and V5). An interaction between aversiveness and hand type showed  rubber-hand-specific activation for (aversive > non-aversive) in other visual  areas (including V1, V2, V3, and V4v). The effect of interpersonal contact on the  processing of aversive stimuli was negatively correlated with the increment of  attentional focus to aversiveness measured by a pain-catastrophizing scale. These  results suggest that interpersonal touch suppresses the processing of aversive  visual stimuli in the occipital cortex. This effect covaried with  aversiveness-insensitivity, such that aversive-insensitive individuals might  require a lesser degree of attentional capture to aversive-stimulus processing.  As joining hands did not influence the subjective ratings of aversiveness,  interpersonal touch may operate by redirecting excessive attention away from  aversive characteristics of the stimuli.

T2  - Experimental brain research
AB  - The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is an experimental paradigm known to produce a bodily illusion. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) combined with  the RHI induces a stronger illusion than the RHI alone. Visuotactile stimulus  synchrony is an important aspect of the RHI. However, the effect of TENS and  visuotactile stimulus synchrony in TENS combined with the RHI remains unknown.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of TENS and visuotactile  stimulus synchrony on the embodiment of an artificial hand when using TENS  combined with the RHI. The participants underwent four experimental conditions in  random order: TENS/noTENS × Synchronous/Asynchronous. TENS was set at an  intensity such that it generated a feeling of electrical paresthesia in the  radial nerve area of the hand but did not cause pain, i.e., 100-Hz pulse  frequency, 80-µs pulse duration, and a constant pulse pattern. A visuotactile  stimulus, either temporally synchronous or asynchronous, was generated using  paintbrush strokes. To evaluate the outcome measures, the participants completed  a questionnaire report and proprioceptive drift assessments (motor response and  perceptual response). There were significant main effects of TENS and  visuotactile synchrony, but no interaction between these factors, on the results  of the questionnaire and the perceptual response. In contrast, there was no  significant effect on the result of the motor response. These findings indicate  that TENS and visuotactile synchrony might affect differently the embodiment of  an artificial hand when using TENS combined with the RHI.

T2  - Pediatric rheumatology online journal
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in children, the long term effect of HSP on endothelial  function is still not clear. The aim of our study was to evaluate the long term  effect of HSP on endothelial function in children and adolescents. METHODS: This  research was an observational prospective study. The study group comprised of 19  children diagnosed with HSP. The minimum interval between the diagnosis with HSP  and endothelial testing was 5 months. Endothelial function evaluation was  assessed by a noninvasive technology named peripheral arterial tonometry, using  an EndoPAT™ device. This method measures blood flow in the limb, in response to  arterial occlusion, and calculates a Reactive Hyperemic Index (RHI) as an index  of endothelial function. RHI values of the study group were compared to those of  a known control group. RESULTS: Nineteen children and adolescents with HSP  underwent endothelial function studies. Endothelial function was compared to that  of a known control group comprising of 23 healthy children and adolescents. The  two groups had similar characteristics, including age, male to female ratio,  height, weight and BMI. Mean RHI was 1.81 in the study group, and 1.87 in the  control group (p = 0.18). Linear regression of the study group, showed a positive  correlation between the time interval from HSP diagnosis to participation in the  study, and between the RHI value (r = 0.542, p = 0.016). RHI levels were  significantly higher in patients who had endothelial function measured more than  6 years since the diagnosis of HSP compared with those patients with less than  6 years follow up (1.98 + 0.74 vs. 1.38 ± 0.43 P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: These  results suggest that HSP causes short term endothelial dysfunction that improves  with time.

T2  - Cognitive neuroscience
AB  - In this reply to the eight commentaries to our article, we discuss three important challenges. First, we discuss the relationship of mirror-touch to other  forms of synesthesia. We note that synesthetic experiences are generally not  mistaken as veridical but this does not mean that they lack percept-like  qualities. We acknowledge that neither Threshold Theory nor Self-Other Theory  offer a direct account of other forms of synesthesia, although we discuss how the  latter could. Second, we discuss alternative explanations. Notably predictive  coding offers a different way of framing our current theory, and extending it to  related phenomena. Finally, we discuss how mirror-touch synesthesia may relate to  other atypical experiences of body ownership such as the rubber hand illusion,  and somatoparaphrenia.

AU  - Maister, Lara

T2  - Cognition
AB  - Previous studies have investigated how existing social attitudes towards other races affect the way we 'share' their bodily experiences, for example in empathy  for pain, and sensorimotor mapping. Here, we ask whether it is possible to alter  implicit racial attitudes by experimentally increasing self-other bodily overlap.  Employing a bodily illusion known as the 'Rubber Hand Illusion', we delivered  multisensory stimulation to light-skinned Caucasian participants to induce the  feeling that a dark-skinned hand belonged to them. We then measured whether this  could change their implicit racial biases against people with dark skin. Across  two experiments, the more intense the participants' illusion of ownership over  the dark-skinned rubber hand, the more positive their implicit racial attitudes  became. Importantly, it was not the pattern of multisensory stimulation per se,  but rather, it was the change in the subjective experience of body ownership that  altered implicit attitudes. These findings suggest that inducing an overlap  between the bodies of self and other through illusory ownership is an effective  way to change and reduce negative implicit attitudes towards outgroups.

AB  - Changing the visual body appearance by use of as virtual reality system, funny mirror, or binocular glasses has been reported to be helpful in rehabilitation of  pain. However, there are interindividual differences in the analgesic effect of  changing the visual body image. We hypothesized that a negative body image  associated with changing the visual body appearance causes interindividual  differences in the analgesic effect although the relationship between the visual  body appearance and analgesic effect has not been clarified. We investigated  whether a negative body image associated with changes in the visual body  appearance increased pain. Twenty-five healthy individuals participated in this  study. To evoke a negative body image, we applied the method of rubber hand  illusion. We created an "injured rubber hand" to evoke unpleasantness associated  with pain, a "hairy rubber hand" to evoke unpleasantness associated with  embarrassment, and a "twisted rubber hand" to evoke unpleasantness associated  with deviation from the concept of normality. We also created a "normal rubber  hand" as a control. The pain threshold was measured while the participant  observed the rubber hand using a device that measured pain caused by thermal  stimuli. Body ownership experiences were elicited by observation of the injured  rubber hand and hairy rubber hand as well as the normal rubber hand. Participants  felt more unpleasantness by observing the injured rubber hand and hairy rubber  hand than the normal rubber hand and twisted rubber hand (p<0.001). The pain  threshold was lower under the injured rubber hand condition than with the other  conditions (p<0.001). We conclude that a negative body appearance associated with  pain can increase pain sensitivity.

AB  - Phantom limb pain (PLP) may be relieved using a visual representation of an intact limb. However, patients with distorted (telescoped) phantoms seem unable  to associate with visualizations of intact limbs. A virtual arm visualization was  matched to the individual's phantom perception and controlled in an augmented  reality (AR) intervention. Seven PLP participants with telescoped phantoms  performed 8 supervised home-based AR-training sessions (45 minutes each) within 2  weeks. The virtual arm was superimposed in AR onto their residual limb and  controlled using electromyography from the residual limb. AR-training sessions  included 3 AR tasks aimed at reengaging the neural circuits related to the lost  limb. Agency (Rubber hand illusion questionnaire) and telescoping (proprioceptive  drift and felt telescoping) were monitored after individual training sessions.  fMRI during lip pursing was assessed before and after intervention. Pain rating  index scores were reduced by 52% (mean change = -1.884, P = .032, d = 1.135).  Numerical rating scale scores of PLP severity (0-6) in patients benefitting from  the intervention were reduced by 41% (mean change = .93 P = .022, d = 1.334). The  lip pursing task illustrated decreased cortical activity in the primary  somatosensory cortex, which correlated to the reduced numerical rating scale  scores of PLP severity. PERSPECTIVE: Two weeks of novel AR interventions in  patients with telescoped phantoms demonstrated reduced PLP and reversal of  cortical reorganization. This research highlights the potential of individualized  AR interventions for PLP and indicate the importance of agency in this type of  treatments.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES: Case report and review of supernumerary phantom limbs in patients suffering from spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: SCI  rehabilitation centre. CASE REPORT: After a ski accident, a 71-year-old man  suffered an incomplete SCI (level C3; AIS C, central cord syndrome), with a C3/C4  dislocation fracture. From the first week after injury, he experienced a phantom  duplication of both upper limbs that lasted for 7 months. The supernumerary limbs  were only occasionally related to painful sensation, specifically when they were  perceived as crossed on his trunk. Although the painful sensations were  responsive to pain medication, the presence of the illusory limb sensations were  persistent. During neurological recovery, the supernumerary limbs gradually  disappeared. A rubber hand illusion paradigm was used twice during recovery to  monitor the patient's ability to integrate visual, tactile and proprioceptive  stimuli. CONCLUSION: Overall, the clinical relevance of supernumerary phantom  limbs is not clear, specific treatment protocols have not yet been developed, and  the underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood. Supernumerary phantom  limbs have been previously reported in patients with (sub)cortical lesions, but  might be rather undocumented in patients suffering from traumatic SCI. For the  appropriate diagnosis and treatment after SCI, supernumerary phantoms should be  distinguished from other phantom sensations and pain syndromes after SCI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although treatment of Crohn's disease has improved with development of tumour necrosis factor antagonists, fewer than 50% of patients have sustained  benefit. Durable maintenance therapy with orally administered alternative  treatments remains an unmet need. We aimed to evaluate the effects of ozanimod,  an oral agent selectively targeting sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1  and 5, on endoscopic disease activity in Crohn's disease. METHODS: STEPSTONE was  a phase 2, uncontrolled, multicentre trial in adults with moderately to severely  active Crohn's disease recruited at 28 hospital and community research centres in  Canada, the USA, Hungary, Poland, and Ukraine. All patients began treatment with  a 7-day dose escalation (4 days on ozanimod 0·25 mg daily followed by 3 days at  0·5 mg daily). Patients then received ozanimod 1·0 mg oral capsule daily for a  further 11 weeks, for a 12-week induction period, followed by a 100-week  extension. The primary endpoint was change in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's  Disease (SES-CD) from baseline to week 12, as determined by a blinded central  reader. Data are reported for the intention-to-treat population. This trial is  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02531113 and EudraCT, number  2015-002025-19, and is completed. FINDINGS: 69 patients were enrolled between Nov  17, 2015, and Aug 18, 2016. At week 12, the mean change from baseline in SES-CD  was -2·2 (SD 6·0); 16 (23·2%, 95% CI 13·9-34·9) patients experienced endoscopic  response. A reduction from baseline in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)  score also was observed (mean change -130·4 [SD 103·9]). Clinical remission (CDAI  <150 points) was shown in 27 (39·1%, 95% CI 27·6-51·6) patients and response  (CDAI decrease from baseline ≥100) in 39 (56·5%, 95% CI 44·0-68·4) of patients.  The mean change from baseline in two-item patient-reported outcome (PRO2, stool  frequency, abdominal pain scores) score was -66·1 (SD 65·4). Mean change from  baseline in Geboes Histology Activity Score (GHAS) was -5·9 (SD 11·0) and in  Robart's Histopathology Index (RHI) -10·6 (25·1). Adverse events were most  frequently those attributed to Crohn's disease, most commonly Crohn's disease  (flare) in 18 (26%) patients. The most commonly reported serious  treatment-related adverse events were Crohn's disease (six [9%]) and abdominal  abscess (two [3%]). INTERPRETATION: Endoscopic, histological, and clinical  improvements were seen within 12 weeks of initiating ozanimod therapy in patients  with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Phase 3 placebo-controlled  trials have been initiated. FUNDING: Celgene Corporation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction precedes coronary artery disease (CAD) and can be measured by peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT). We examined the  applicability of PAT to detect a low risk of CAD in a chest pain clinic. METHODS:  In 93 patients, PAT was performed resulting in reactive hyperaemia (RHI) and  augmentation (AIx) indices. Patients were risk classified according to  HeartScore, Diamond and Forrester pretest probability (DF), exercise testing  (X-ECG), and computed tomography calcium scoring (CCS) and angiography (CTA).  Correlations, risk group differences and prediction of revascularisation within 1  year were calculated. RESULTS: RHI correlated with HeartScore (r = - 0.21,  p = 0.05), AIx with DF (r = 0.26, p = 0.01). However, both were not significantly  different between normal and ischaemic X-ECG groups. In addition RHI and AIx were  similar between low risk as compared with intermediate-to-high risk, based on  risk algorithms (RHI: 1.98 (0.67) vs 1.94 (0.78); AIx: 0.0 (21) vs 5.0 (25);  p = NS), or CCS and CTA (RHI: 1.99 (0.58) vs 1.89 (0.82); AIx: - 2.0 (24) vs 4.0  (25); p = NS). Finally, RHI and AIx failed to predict revascularisation (RHI: OR  1.42, CI 0.65-3.1; AIx: OR 1.02, CI 0.98-1.05). CONCLUSIONS: PAT cannot detect a  low risk of CAD, possibly because RHI and AIx versus X-ECG, CCS and CTA represent  independent processes.

T2  - Coronary artery disease
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is a key step in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular complications. We  examined whether peripheral endothelial function, as assessed by fingertip  reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT), can provide additional  clinical value to traditional risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in  predicting coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We included 118 stable  patients who were referred for coronary angiography for chest pain evaluation or  due to abnormal stress test results. A natural logarithmic value of the RH-PAT  index (Ln_RHI) was obtained before cardiac catheterization by an independent  operator. Significant CAD was defined as luminal stenosis of at least 70% (≥50%  at left main) and/or fractional flow reserve of up to 0.80 in one or more major  coronary arteries or their major branches. RESULTS: Levels of Ln_RHI were  significantly lower in patients with CAD (n=60) compared with patients without  CAD (n=58; 0.69±0.29 vs. 0.88±0.27, P<0.001). Ln_RHI was significantly associated  with CAD independent from traditional risk factors (odds ratio for a 0.1 decrease  in Ln_RHI=1.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.52, P=0.01). The net  reclassification index was improved when Ln_RHI was added to traditional risk  factors (0.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.97, P=0.001). CONCLUSION:  Peripheral endothelial function, as assessed by RH-PAT, improved risk  stratification when added to traditional risk factors. RH-PAT is potentially  useful for identifying patients at high risk for CAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HPTN 084 compared the safety and efficacy of long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB) to daily oral TDF/FTC for prevention of HIV-1 in uninfected  African women. Like a similar trial in MSM/TGW (HPTN 083), the trial was stopped  early for efficacy, expediting the need to consider introduction strategies for  different populations. We examine survey and qualitative data from a four-country  sub-study to examine oral and injectable PrEP acceptability and considerations  for CAB access among African women. METHODS: Participants completed baseline and  follow-up surveys on HIV risk perception, sexual behavior. product acceptability  and adherence during the blinded trial. Additionally, up to two in-depth  interviews each with 73 sub-study participants explored product use and  trial-related experiences, during the blinded and unblinded study periods. Using  survey data, we classified participants as: engaged in female sex work (FSW),  having multiple non-transactional partners, or monogamous. A study statistician  identified participants' assigned study arm. We followed a thematic analysis  process to read transcripts, develop a codebook and apply codes in NVivo to  transcripts with intermittent intercoder reliability checks; using Excel matrices  to explore differences across risk categories and study arms. FINDINGS:  Participants overwhelmingly preferred injections to pills, appreciating the ease,  convenience, and privacy of a long-acting formulation. Many participants  described challenges with contraceptive and/or study pill adherence, impeded by  late night work, unexpected travel, or heavy drinking. Women in the TDF/FTC arm  were more likely to describe side effects, compared to those in the CAB arm. Pain  also varied widely by study arm. When considering post-trial access to CAB,  limited PrEP knowledge, cost and concerns around stigma and poor service quality  were potential access barriers. CONCLUSION: Women's desire for privacy and ease  of use outweighed injectable concerns, resulting in a strong preference for CAB.  Cost and accessibility will need to be addressed by implementation programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Threatening a perceptually embodied rubber hand with noxious stimuli has been shown to generate levels of anxiety similar to that experienced  when a real hand is threatened. The aim of this study was to investigate skin  conductance response, self-reported anxiety and the incidence, type and location  of sensations when a perceptually embodied rubber hand was exposed to threatening  and non-threatening stimuli. METHODS: A repeated measures cross-over design was  used whereby 20 participants (≥18 years, 14 females) received a threatening  (syringe needle) and non-threatening (soft brush) stimulus to a perceptually  embodied rubber hand. Perceptual embodiment was achieved using a soft brush to  synchronously stroke the participant's real hand (out of view) and a rubber hand  (in view). Then the investigator approached the rubber hand with a syringe needle  (threat) or soft brush (non-threat). RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA found that  approaching the perceptually embodied rubber hand with either stimulus produced  statistically significant reductions in the rated intensity of response to the  following questions (p<0.01): 'How strongly does it feel like the rubber hand is  yours?'; 'How strongly does it feel like the rubber hand is part of your body?';  and 'How strongly does it feel you can move the rubber hand?'. However, there  were no statistically significant differences in scores between needle and brush  stimuli. Repeated measures ANOVA on skin conductance response found statistically  significant effects for experimental Events (baseline; stroking; perceptual  embodiment; stimuli approaching rubber hand; stimuli touching rubber hand;  p<0.001) but not for Condition (needle versus brush p=0.964) or experimental  Event×Condition interaction (p=0.160). Ten of the 20 participants (50%) reported  that they experienced a sensation arising from the rubber hand when the rubber  hand was approached and touched by either the needle and/or brush but these  sensations lacked precision in location, timing, and nature. CONCLUSION AND  IMPLICATIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that the increase in arousal in  response to stimuli entering the peripersonal space may not be selective for  threat. There was tentative evidence that more intense sensations were  experienced when a perceptually embodied rubber hand was approached by a  threatening stimulus. Our findings provide initial insights and should serve as a  catalyst for further research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The high incidence rate of cardiovascular (CV) events had led to a comprehensive appraisal for identifying patients who are at risk for CV disease.  However, CV traditional risk factors, such as Framingham risk score (FRS), failed  exhaustively to predict CV events. METHODS: 402 participants (mean age, 58 [12]  years; 45% male) using fingertip peripheral artery tonometry at Mayo Clinic in  Rochester, Minnesota, were recruited in the present study. Measurements included  reactive hyperemia index (RHI) and pain-induced peripheral artery tonometry  (PIPAT). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 3.8 (2.7-7.7) years, 95 CV events  occurred. Both first minute PIPAT and RHI were independently associated with  events (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77 [95% CI, 0.61-0.98]; P = 0.038 and HR, 0.75 [95%  CI, 0.59-0.96]; P = 0.019, respectively). The C statistic values of FRS,  FRS + first minute PIPAT, FRS + RHI, and FRS + RHI + first minute PIPAT were  0.704, 0.722, 0.694, and 0.726, respectively. Furthermore, the addition of first  minute PIPAT, RHI, and first minute PIPAT + RHI to FRS results in net  reclassification improvement (NRI) in the intermediate-risk group (18.1%,  P = 0.031; 18.1%, P = 0.035; 21%, P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: First minute PIPAT is a  risk marker for adverse CV. Addition of first minute PIPAT to FRS increased the  discrimination in the receiver operating characteristic analysis. It also  increased NRI compared with FRS alone.

AB  - Multi-modal visuo-tactile stimulation of the type performed in the rubber hand illusion can induce the brain to temporarily incorporate external objects into  the body image. In this study we show that audio-visual stimulation combined with  mental imagery more rapidly elicits an elevated physiological response (skin  conductance) after an unexpected threat to a virtual limb, compared to  audio-visual stimulation alone. Two groups of subjects seated in front of a  monitor watched a first-person perspective view of slow movements of two virtual  arms intercepting virtual balls rolling towards the viewer. One group was  instructed to simply observe the movements of the two virtual arms, while the  other group was instructed to observe the virtual arms and imagine that the arms  were their own. After 84 seconds the right virtual arm was unexpectedly "stabbed"  by a knife and began "bleeding". This aversive stimulus caused both groups to  show a significant increase in skin conductance. In addition, the  observation-with-imagery group showed a significantly higher skin conductance  (p<0.05) than the observation-only group over a 2-second period shortly after the  aversive stimulus onset. No corresponding change was found in subjects' heart  rates. Our results suggest that simple visual input combined with mental imagery  may induce the brain to measurably temporarily incorporate external objects into  its body image.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with chest pain, ischemia, and no obstructive coronary artery disease often have coronary vascular dysfunction (CVaD). Peripheral vascular  reactivity to mental stress may contribute mechanistic understanding of  stress-induced ischemia in women with CVaD. METHODS: 62 women (41 CVaD and 21  controls) underwent mental stress testing (MST) with anger recall, mental  arithmetic, and forehead cold pressor (COP) challenge. Emotional arousal was  measured (Likert scale). Reactive hyperemia index (RHI) was calculated before and  after MST by peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT). Stress PAT ratio (SPR) of pulse  amplitude during stress to rest was obtained to measure vasoconstriction.  Wilcoxson rank sum test was used for analysis. RESULTS: Mean age of CVaD and  control groups was 58±9 and 55±10years (p=0.73). Baseline RHI correlated with  coronary endothelial function (r=0.36, p=0.03) and inversely with RHI change  post-MST (r=-0.51, p<0.001). During MST, 10% of controls reported chest pain vs.  41% of CVaD subjects (p=0.01). RHI did not change significantly after MST in  either group. CVaD subjects had lower SPR vs. controls during mental arithmetic  (0.54 [0.15, 1.46] vs. 0.67 [0.36, 1.8], p=0.039), not evident in the other  tasks. Vasoconstriction inversely correlated with anxiety (r=-3.4, p=0.03),  frustration (r=-0.37, p=0.02), and feeling challenged (r=-0.37, p=0.02) in CVaD  but not controls. CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress peripheral vascular reactivity is  elevated in women with CVaD compared to controls. Elevated vascular reactivity  may be one contributor to stress-induced chest pain in CVaD. Interventions that  modulate vasoconstrictive responses may be of benefit and should be tested in  clinical trials in women with CVaD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the strength of perceptual embodiment achieved during an adapted version of the rubber hand illusion (RHI)  in response to a series of modified transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation  (TENS) pulse patterns with dynamic temporal and spatial characteristics which are  more akin to the mechanical brush stroke in the original RHI. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: A repeated-measures counterbalanced experimental study was conducted  where each participant was exposed to four TENS interventions: continuous pattern  TENS; burst pattern TENS (fixed frequency of 2 bursts per second of 100 pulses  per second); amplitude-modulated pattern TENS (intensity increasing from zero to  a preset level, then back to zero again in a cyclical fashion); and sham (no  current) TENS. Participants rated the intensity of the RHI using a three-item  numerical rating scale (each item was ranked from 0 to 10). Friedman's analysis  of ranks (one-factor repeated measure) was used to test the differences in  perceptual embodiment between TENS innervations; alpha was set at p ≤ 0.05.  RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in the intensity of  misattribution and perceptual embodiment between sham and active TENS  interventions, but no significant differences between the three active TENS  conditions (amplitude-modulated TENS, burst TENS, and continuous TENS).  Amplitude-modulated and burst TENS produced significantly higher intensity scores  for misattribution sensation and perceptual embodiment compared with sham (no  current) TENS, whereas continuous TENS did not. CONCLUSION: The findings provide  tentative, but not definitive, evidence that TENS parameters with dynamic spatial  and temporal characteristics may produce more intense misattribution sensations  and intense perceptual embodiment than parameters with static characteristics  (e.g., continuous pulse patterns).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) is used widely to assess cardiovascular risk in patients with chest pain. The utility of carotid  intima-media thickness (CIMT) and endothelial function as assessed by reactive  hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry index (RHI) in risk stratifying patients  with angina-like symptoms needs to be defined. We investigated whether the  addition of CIMT and RHI to Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score (FCVRS) and MPS  improves comprehensive cardiovascular risk prediction in patients presenting with  angina-like symptoms. METHODS: We enrolled 343 consecutive patients with  angina-like symptoms suspected of having stable angina. MPS, CIMT, and RHI were  performed and patients were followed for cardiovascular events for a median of  5.3 years (range 4.4-6.2). Patients were stratified by FCVRS and MPS. RESULTS:  During the follow-up, 57 patients (16.6%) had cardiovascular events. Among  patients without perfusion defect, low RHI was significantly associated with  cardiovascular events in the intermediate and high FCVRS groups (hazard ratio  (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] of RHI ≤ 2.11 was 6.99 [1.34-128] in the  intermediate FCVRS group and 6.08 [1.08-114] in the high FCVRS group).  Furthermore, although MPS did not predict, only RHI predicted hard cardiovascular  events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) independent from  FCVRS, and adding RHI to FCVRS improved net reclassification index (20.9%, 95% CI  0.8-41.1, p = 0.04). Especially, RHI was significantly associated with hard  cardiovascular events in the high FCVRS group (HR [95% CI] of RHI ≤ 1.93 was 5.66  [1.54-36.4], p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral endothelial function may improve  discrimination in identifying at-risk patients for future cardiovascular events  when added to FCVRS-MPS-based risk stratification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We compared functional, electrophysiological and morphological parameters after SCI in two groups of rats Sprague Dawley (SD) rats with normal  vision and blind rats from a SD-substrain "Royal College of Surgeons" (SD/RCS)  who lose their photoreceptor cells after birth due to a genetic defect in the  retinal pigment epithelium. For these animals skin-, intramuscular-, and tendon  receptors are major available means to resolve spatial information. OBJECTIVE:  The purpose of this study was to check whether increased sensitivity in SD/RCS  rats would promote an improved recovery after SCI. METHODS: All rats were  subjected to severe compression of the spinal cord at vertebra Th8, spinal cord  segment Th10. Recovery of locomotion was analyzed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks  after SCI using video recordings of beam walking and inclined ladder climbing.  Five functional parameters were studied: foot-stepping angle (FSA), rump-height  index (RHI) estimating paw placement and body weight support, respectively,  number of correct ladder steps (CLS) assessing skilled hindlimb movements, the  BBB-locomotor score and an established urinary bladder score (BS). Sensitivity  tests were followed by electrophysiological measurement of M- and H-wave  amplitudes from contractions of the plantar musculature after stimulation of the  tibial nerve. The closing morphological measurements included lesion volume and  expression of astro- and microglia below the lesion. RESULTS: Numerical  assessments of BBB, FSA, BS, lesion volume and GFAP-expression revealed no  significant differences between both strains. However, compared to SD-rats, the  blind SD/RCS animals significantly improved RHI and CLS by 6 - 12 weeks after  SCI. To our surprise the withdrawal latencies in the blind SD/RCS rats were  longer and the amplitudes of M- and H-waves lower. The expression of  IBA1-immunoreactivity in the lumbar enlargement was lower than in the SD-animals.  CONCLUSION: The longer withdrawal latencies suggest a decreased sensitivity in  the blind SD/RCS rats, which promotes better recovery after SCI. In this way our  results provide indirect support to earlier work showing, that hypersensitivity  and chronic pain after contusive SCI impair the recovery of locomotor function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although endothelial function is a marker for cardiovascular risk, endothelial dysfunction assessment is not routinely used in daily clinical  practice. A growing challenge has emerged in identifying patients prone to  cardiovascular events. We aim to investigate whether abnormal endothelial  function may be associated with adverse 5-year outcomes in patients presenting to  a chest pain unit (CPU). METHODS: Following endothelial function testing using  EndoPAT 2000 in 300 consecutive patients without a history of coronary artery  disease, patients underwent coronary computerized tomographic angiography (CCTA)  or single-photon emission computed tomography according to availability. RESULTS:  Mean 10-year Framingham risk score (FRS) was 6.6 ± 5.9%; mean 10-year  atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk was 7.1 ± 7.2%; median  reactive hyperemia index (RHI) as a measure of an endothelial function 2.0 and  mean was 2.0 ± 0.4. During a 5-year follow-up, the 30 patients who developed  major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including all-cause mortality,  nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or angina  pectoris, stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting, and percutaneous coronary  interventions, had higher 10-year FRS (9.6 ± 7.8 vs. 6.3 ± 5.6%; P  = 0.032),  higher 10-year ASCVD risk (10.4 ± 9.2 vs. 6.7 ± 6.9%; P  = 0.042), lower baseline  RHI (1.6 ± 0.5 vs. 2.1 ± 0.4; P  < 0.001) and a greater degree of coronary  atherosclerotic lesions (53 vs. 3%, P  < 0.001) on CCTA compared with patients  without MACE. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that RHI below the median was an  independent predictor of 5-year MACE (odds ratio 5.567, 95% confidence interval  1.955-15.853; P  = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that noninvasive  endothelial function testing may contribute to clinical efficacy in triaging  patients in the CPU and in predicting 5-year MACE.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of  cannabinoids and an anti-inflammatory diet, alone and in combination, for the  management of neuropathic pain (NP) after spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: Two  Canadian SCI rehabilitation centers. METHODS: A sample of 144 individuals with  SCI will receive either an anti-inflammatory diet, cannabinoids or a placebo for  6 weeks. Following this, a combined effect of these treatments will be evaluated  for a further 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the change in NP as  assessed by the numeric rating scale (NRS). Secondary outcomes will include  changes in inflammation, mood, sleep, spasticity, cost-effectiveness, and  function. CONCLUSION: This study will assess the efficacy of an anti-inflammatory  diet and cannabinoids (individually and in combination) for the treatment of NP  following SCI. Results may reveal a cost-effective, side-effect free intervention  strategy which could be utilized for the long-term management of NP following  SCI.

AB  - Background: Optimal management of neuropathic pain (NP) is essential to enhancing health-related quality of life for individuals living with spinal cord injury  (SCI). A key strategic priority for the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation (ONF) and  Rick Hansen Institute (RHI) is optimizing NP management after SCI. Aims: A  National Canadian Summit, sponsored by ONF and RHI, was held to develop a  strategic plan to improve NP management after SCI. Methods: In a one-day meeting  held in Toronto, Ontario, a multidisciplinary panel of 18 Canadian stakeholders  utilized a consensus workshop methodology to (1) describe the current state of  the field, (2) create a long-term vision, and (3) identify steps for moving into  action. Results: A review of the current state of the field identified strengths  including rigourously developed evidence syntheses and practice landscape  documentation. Identified gaps included limited evidence on NP hindering  recommendation development in evidence syntheses, absence of a national strategy,  care silos with limited cross-continuum connections, limited consumer  involvement, and limited practice standard implementation. The panel identified  key themes for a long-term vision to improve the management of SCI NP in Canada,  including establishing an integrated collaborative network; standardized care and  outcome evaluation; education; advocacy; and directing resources to innovative  solutions. The panel identified the next step as prioritization of areas that  will have the greatest impact in a 5-year time frame. Conclusion: A strategic  plan outlining a long-term vision to improve management of NP after SCI in Canada  was developed and will inform future activities of the sponsors.

AB  - PURPOSE: The role of endothelial-dependent function in patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is not clear. Endothelial dysfunction may  contribute to the pathophysiological processes occurring after STEMI and  influence the extension of myocardial necrosis. Endothelial-dependent dysfunction  evaluated by peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) has already showed to be  correlated with microvascular coronary endothelial dysfunction. Our purpose was  to evaluate the impact of endothelial dysfunction on peak Troponin I (TnI)  values, as a surrogate for the extension of myocardial infarction, in patients  with STEMI treated with primary angioplasty (P-PCI). METHODS: 58 patients with  STEMI treated with P-PCI (mean age 59.0 ± 14.0 years, 46 males) were included.  Endothelial function was assessed by reactive hyperaemia index (RHI) determined  by PAT. Patients were divided in two groups according to the previously reported  RHI threshold for high risk (1.67). The extension of myocardial necrosis was  evaluated by peak TnI levels. RESULTS: RHI median value was 1.78 (IQR0.74);25  patients had endothelial dysfunction (RHI b 1.67). The two groups had no  significant differences in age, gender, main risk factors and pain-to-balloon  time. Patients with an RHI b 1.67 had significant larger infarcts: TnI 73.5 ng/mL  (IQR 114.42 ng/mL) versus TnI 33.2 ng/mL (IQR 65.2 ng/mL); p = 0.028. On  multivariate analysis, the presence of an RHI b 1.67 kept significant impact on  TnI peak values (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of endothelial-dependent  dysfunction, assessed by PAT, is related with higher peak TnI values in STEMI  patients treated with P-PCI. These results strength the possibility that  endothelial-dependent dysfunction may be a marker of poor prognosis and  eventually a therapeutic target in patients with STEMI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial function is a marker for cardiovascular risk. Thus, abnormal endothelial function may be associated with adverse 1-year outcome in  patients presenting to the emergency department chest pain unit (CPU). METHODS:  Following endothelial function testing, using EndoPAT 2000 in 300 consecutive  subjects with chest pain and no history of coronary artery disease (CAD)  presenting to CPU, patients underwent coronary computerized tomographic  angiography (CCTA) or single-photon emission computed tomography according to  availability. RESULTS: Mean 10-year Framingham risk score (FRS) was 6.6±5.9%,  median reactive hyperemia index (RHI) as a measure of endothelial function 2.08  and mean was 2.0±0.4. During a 1-year follow-up, the 20 (6.6%) patients who  developed major adverse cardiovascular end-points (MACE), including all-cause  mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or  angina pectoris, stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous  coronary interventions, had higher 10-year FRS (10.5±8.2% vs 6.3±5.7%; p<0.001),  lower baseline RHI (1.43±0.41 vs 2.10±0.44; p<0.001) and a greater extent of  coronary atherosclerosis lesions (70% vs 3.9%, p<0.001) in the CPU CCTA, compared  to those without MACE. RHI≤the median was associated with higher 1-year MACE (13%  vs 0.7%, p<0.001) compared to RHI>the median. Multivariate analysis demonstrated  that RHI≤the median is an independent predictor of coronary atherosclerosis  lesions in the CPU CCTA (OR 5.98, 95% CI 03.29-10.88; p<0.001) and 1-year MACE  (OR 15.207, 95% CI 2.00-115.33; p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that  non-invasive endothelial function testing may have clinical utility in triaging  patients in the CPU and in predicting 1-year MACE.

AB  - Pain synaesthetes experience pain in a presensitised region when observing or imagining another person in pain. We conducted an upper-limb embodiment study  using a modified rubber-hand illusion in which lower-limb amputees originally  participated as control subjects for the upper-limb amputees. While we found all  subjects experienced topographic illusory sensations, we also serendipitously  found that lower-limb amputee pain synaesthetes experienced pain or a motor  response in their phantom leg when the embodied hand was threatened (e.g., with a  retractable knife, mousetrap, or syringe) or submitted to high-frequency  stimulation (e.g., vibration). Embodiment illusions were brought about by  touching, manipulating, or threatening a rubber or real hand which was observed  through a mirror so that it was superimposed upon the target hand (phantom hand  for upper-limb amputees, or real hand in others). Participants included eight  pain synaesthetes (six lower-limb amputees, one upper-limb amputee, and one  nonamputee), and thirty-one controls (eight lower-limb amputees, twelve  upper-limb amputees, and eleven nonamputees). We documented participant's  subjective reports, together with quantitative measures including the  Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy. We found no association between pain  synaesthesia and empathy scores. On the basis of related literature we suggest  that pain synaesthetes likely experienced phantom-leg pain because (a) the motor  system was already engaged during visual capture; (b) threatening stimuli, to  which they are hyper-vigilant, triggered avoidance or 'escape' motor schemata;  and (c) there could be no feedback confirming that initiated motor schemata for  the phantom limb were successfully performed. Ultimately, we have further defined  this new condition, synaesthesia for pain, as not only having a sensory pain  component, but also a key motor component, manifesting itself in avoidance,  contraction, and withdrawal 'actions'.

T2  - Cognitive, affective & behavioral neuroscience
AB  - Social-psychological research has suggested that being imitated changes the way that we experience others: We like someone who imitates us more, and the  interaction with this person runs more smoothly. Whether being imitated also  affects basic social reactions, such as empathy for pain, is an open question.  Empathy for pain refers to the observation that perceiving another person in pain  results in pain-related brain activation in the observer. The aim of the present  study was to combine the two lines of research, to investigate whether being  imitated can influence empathy for pain. To this end, we developed an  experimental approach combining an imitation task with a pain perception task.  Subjective reports, as well as physiological responses, indicated that being  imitated enhances affective responses to seeing someone else in pain.  Furthermore, using rubber hand illusion measures, we provided evidence for the  role of shared representations in the sensory and motor domains as a core  underlying mechanism. In this way, our study integrated social-psychological  research on being imitated with cognitive research on empathy for pain. This has  broad implications, since imitation plays a crucial role in our daily social  interactions, and our study provides insights into a basic cognitive mechanism  that might underlie these social situations.

AB  - Limited studies have been conducted on the safety and effectiveness of heterologous COVID-19 vaccine boosting in lower income settings, especially those  with high-HIV prevalence., The Sisonke Heterologous mRNA-1273 boost after prime  with Ad26.COV2.S (SHERPA) trial evaluated a mRNA-1273 boost after Ad26.COV2.S  priming in South Africa. SHERPA was a single-arm, open-label, phase 3 study  nested in the Sisonke implementation trial of 500000 healthcare workers (HCWs).  Sisonke participants were offered mRNA-1273 boosters between May and November  2022, when Omicron sub-lineages were circulating. Adverse events (AE) were  self-reported, and co-primary endpoints (SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19  hospitalizations or deaths) were collected through national databases. We used  Cox regression models with booster status as a time-varying covariate to  determine the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of the mRNA-1273 booster among  SHERPA versus unboosted Sisonke participants. Of 11248 SHERPA participants in the  rVE analysis cohort (79.3% female, median age 41), 45.4% had received one and  54.6% two Ad26.COV2.S doses. Self-reported comorbidities included HIV (18.7%),  hypertension (12.9%) and diabetes (4.6%). In multivariable analysis including  413161 unboosted Sisonke participants, rVE of the booster was 59% (95%CI 29-76%)  against SARS-CoV-2 infection: 77% (95%CI 9-94%) in the one-Ad26.COV2.S dose group  and 52% (95%CI 13-73%) in the two-dose group. Severe COVID-19 was identified in  148 unboosted Sisonke participants, and only one SHERPA participant with severe  HIV-related immunosuppression. Of 11798 participants in the safety analysis, 228  (1.9%) participants reported 575 reactogenicity events within 7 days of the  booster (most commonly injection site pain, malaise, myalgia, swelling,  induration and fever). More reactogenicity events were reported among those with  prior SARS-CoV-2 infections (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.03, 95%CI 1.59-2.59) and  less among people living with HIV (PLWH) (aOR 0.49, 95%CI 0.34-0.69). There were  115 unsolicited adverse events (AEs) within 28 days of vaccination. No related  serious AEs were reported. In an immunogenicity sub-study, mRNA-1273 increased  binding and neutralizing antibody titres and spike-specific T-cell responses 4  weeks after boosting regardless of the number of prior Ad26.COV2.S doses, or HIV  status, and generated Omicron spike-specific cross-reactive responses. mRNA-1273  boosters after one or two Ad26.COV2.S doses were well-tolerated, safe and  effective against Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs and PLWH. Trial  registration: The SHERPA study is registered in the Pan African Clinical Trials  Registry (PACTR): PACTR202310615330649 and the South African National Clinical  Trial Registry (SANCTR): DOH-27-052022-5778.

AB  - PURPOSE: Spinal cord injury (SCI), a profound impairment of sensorimotor functions, is often associated with pain related phenomena, including mechanical  allodynia, a condition in which non-painful tactile sensation is perceived as  pain. Pain and somatic sensation are undeniable markers of normal bodily  awareness. However, the mechanism by which they are integrated into a coherent  sense of the bodily self remains largely unclear. In this study, we investigated  the effect of high-level multisensory manipulation on subjective experiences of  pain, touch, and body-ownership. METHODS: We administered visuo-tactile  stimulation based on the rubber hand illusion. In a longitudinal study, we  compared the strength of the illusion in a male with SCI, who initially had lost  somatosensation in all his fingers, but a few months later reported signs of  tactile allodynia restricted to the left C6-dermatome. RESULTS: After the  restoration of some somatosensation, even if it were painful, synchronous but not  asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation induced body illusion. Previously painful  stimuli were temporarily perceived as less painful, and the patient further  regained tactile sensations in adjacent numb areas. CONCLUSIONS: The sensations  of touch and pain are mutually influenced and inextricably linked to a coherent  representation of one's own body. Multisensory manipulations affecting the  perception and representation of the body might thus offer a powerful opportunity  to mitigate nociceptive and somatic abnormalities.

AB  - Most amputees experience phantom limbs, or the sensation that their amputated limb is still attached to the body. Phantom limbs can be perceived in the  location previously occupied by the intact limb, or they can gradually retract  inside the stump, a phenomenon referred to as "telescoping".  Telescoping is  relevant from a clinical point of view, as it tends to be related to increased  levels of phantom pain. In the current study we demonstrate how a full-body  illusion can be used to temporarily revoke telescoping sensations in upper limb  amputees. During this illusion participants view the body of a mannequin from a  first person perspective while being subjected to synchronized visuo-tactile  stimulation through stroking, which makes them experience the mannequin's body as  their own. In Experiment 1 we used an intact mannequin, and showed that amputees  can experience ownership of an intact body as well as referral of touch from both  hands of the mannequin. In Experiment 2 and 3 we used an amputated mannequin, and  demonstrated that depending on the spatial location of the strokes applied to the  mannequin, participants experienced their phantom hand to either remain  telescoped, or to actually be located below the stump. The effects were supported  by subjective data from questionnaires, as well as verbal reports of the  perceived location of the phantom hand in a visual judgment task. These findings  are of particular interest, as they show that the temporary revoking of  telescoping sensations does not necessarily have to involve the visualization of  an intact hand or illusory movement of the phantom (as in the rubber hand  illusion or mirror visual feedback therapy), but that it can also be obtained  through mere referral of touch from the stump to the spatial location  corresponding to that previously occupied by the intact hand. Moreover, our study  also provides preliminary evidence for the fact that these manipulations can have  an effect on phantom pain sensations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with angina-like symptoms without myocardial perfusion scintigram (MPS)-verified abnormality may still be at risk for cardiovascular  events. We hypothesized that insulin resistance could play a role in this  population even without diagnosed diabetes. We further explored physiological and  blood biomarkers, as well as global gene expression patterns that could be  closely related to impaired glucose homeostasis to deepen our mechanistic  understanding. METHODS: A total of 365 non-diabetic patients with suspected  myocardial ischemia referred to MPS were enrolled and followed up regarding  event-free survival with a median time of 5.1 years. All patients underwent  endothelial function assessment by reactive hyperemic index (RHI) using EndoPAT  and extensive biomarker analysis. Whole blood global gene expression pathway  analysis was performed in a subset of patients. RESULTS: Homeostasis model  assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) added independent prognostic value in  patients without myocardial perfusion defects. In a multivariable analysis,  HOMA-IR was inversely associated with low RHI. Furthermore, elevated HOMA-IR was  associated with decreased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor D, stem  cell factor and endocan as well as to increased level of interleukin-6. Global  gene expression pathway analysis of whole blood cells showed that high HOMA-IR  and impaired endothelial function were associated with upregulated  pro-inflammatory pathways and down-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor-2  pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin resistance measured by HOMA-IR is associated with  endothelial dysfunction and confers independent prognostic information in  non-diabetic patients with chest pain without myocardial perfusion defects.  Increased systemic pro-inflammatory state and decreased levels of pro-angiogenic  vascular growth factors may be important underlying molecular mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With limited access to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in lower income countries, and people living with HIV (PLWH) largely excluded from clinical  trials, Part A of the multicentre CoVPN 3008 (Ubuntu) study aimed to assess the  safety of mRNA-1273, the relative effectiveness of hybrid versus vaccine  immunity, and SARS-CoV-2 viral persistence among PLWH in East and Southern Africa  during the omicron outbreak. METHODS: Previously unvaccinated adults with HIV  and/or other comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 received either one  (hybrid immunity) or two (vaccine immunity) 100-mcg doses of ancestral strain  mRNA-1273 in the first month, depending on baseline evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2  infection. In a prospective cohort study design, we used covariate-adjusted Cox  regression and counterfactual cumulative incidence methods to determine the  hazard ratio and relative risk of COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 with hybrid versus  vaccine immunity within six months. The ongoing Ubuntu study is registered on  ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05168813) and this work was conducted from December 2021  to March 2023. FINDINGS: Between December 2021 and September 2022, 14,237  participants enrolled, and 14,002 (83% PLWH, 69% SARS-CoV-2 seropositive) were  included in the analyses. Vaccinations were safe and well tolerated. Common  adverse events were pain or tenderness at the injection site (26.7%), headache  (20.4%), and malaise (20.3%). Severe adverse events were rare (0.8% of  participants after the first and 1.1% after the second vaccination), and none  were life-threatening or fatal. Among PLWH, the median CD4 count was 635 cells/μl  and 18.5% had HIV viraemia. The six-month cumulative incidences in the hybrid  immunity and vaccine immunity groups were 2.02% (95% confidence interval [CI]  1.61-2.44) and 3.40% (95% CI 2.30-4.49) for COVID-19, and 0.048% (95% CI  0.00-0.10) and 0.32% (95% CI 0.59-0.63) for severe COVID-19. Among all PLWH the  hybrid immunity group had a 42% lower hazard rate of COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR]  0.58; 95% CI 0.44-0.77; p < 0.001) and a 73% lower hazard rate of severe COVID-19  (HR 0.27; 95% CI 0.07-1.04; p = 0.056) than the vaccine immunity group, but this  effect was not seen among PLWH with CD4 counts <350 cells/μl or HIV viraemia.  Twenty PLWH had persistent SARS-CoV-2 virus at least 50 days. INTERPRETATION:  Hybrid immunity was associated with superior protection from COVID-19 compared to  vaccine immunity with the ancestral mRNA-1273 vaccine. Persistent infections  among immunocompromised PLWH may provide reservoirs for emerging variants.  FUNDING: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe plasma vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) levels and related factors in patients with unstable angina pectoris(UAP). METHODS: A total  of 108 consecutive patients with chest pain hospitalized in our department from  October to December 2014 were included. They were divided into UAP (n=78) and  non-CHD group (n=30) by the result of coronary angiography(CAG). Coronary artery  lesion was assessed according to the Gensini score, serum lipids,  homocysteine(Hcy) levels and other biochemical indicators were also determined.  The peripheral arterial tonometry was evaluated by reactive hyperemia index(RHI)  measured by Endo-PAT2000 Noninvasive Diagnostic System.The level of plasma VEGF  was detected in patients with unstable angina pectoris. Multiple linear  regression analysis was used to analyze the correlations between VEGF and various  related factors. RESULTS: Percent of male gender, triglyceride (TG) and Hcy  levels were significantly higher in UAP group than in no-CHD group(all P<0.05).  VEGF values was significantly higher ((102.1 ± 55.7)ng/L vs.(80.9 ± 38.1)ng/L,  P<0.05), while RHI was significantly lower (1.53 ± 0.27 vs.1.65 ± 0.32, P<0.05)  in UAP group than in no-CHD group. Multiple linear regression analysis showed  that VEGF value was significantly correlated with degree of coronary artery  stenosis, Gensini score and RHI (β=38.03, P<0.01; β=0.51, P<0.01; β=-69.30,  P=0.03; respectively). CONCLUSION: VEGF levels are significantly increased in  patients with unstable angina pectoris, and VEGF level is significantly  associated with the degree of coronary artery stenosis, Gensini score and RHI. V  EGF level might serve as a new biochemical indicator for coronary artery lesion  in patients with UAP.
